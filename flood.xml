Flooding may affect locations near the Bristol Avon, Tetbury Avon, Sherston Avon with low lying land and roads expected to be most affected, particularly low-lying areas in Tetbury, Badminton, Brook End at Luckington, Corsham, Lacock and the road at Reybridge. Further rainfall is expected over the weekend, and river levels are expected to rise again in response. We are closely monitoring the situation and will issue further alerts and warnings if required.

We will continue to monitor the situation and will issue further alerts or warnings if necessary.
