<title>Unpermitted roadworks problem, 21st May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7598628</link>
<description>Customer has called and would like to raise some concerns regarding these WWU works. They have gone to use the footpath and approached the workers. The footway was closed and there was no prior signage, the workers were not helpful in engaging with the customer and has stated they were told to walk down the main road while a lorry was lifting large yellow pipes over the bridge. They said there was no clear alternative route for pedestrians and this is a regular school route and lots of children need access. Please can this be looked into and the customer will pursue this with WWU because of the way they have spoken to the MOPs. Customer did not wish to leave any personal details.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7598628&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
