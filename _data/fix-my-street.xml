<title>Rubbish in the undergrowth, 16th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8425743</link>
<description>This rubbish that is collecting in the bushes by the back of the removal company at pilgrove Way opposite the back of all saints academy is just growing week by week. Mainly can and bottles. Not only is it unsightly but its a hazard to wildlife. It&amp;#39;s been reported here previously but as usual nothing has been done. Perhaps those serving community service orders from the courts could help the community as part of their sentence by litter picking ?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8425743.0.jpeg?322659cf&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 25, Pilgrove Way, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8425743&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Street lamp number 34 out, 15th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8423843</link>
<description>Lamp number 34 on Kidnappers Lane is permanently out, leaving a dark area on the pavement regularly used by children going to the High School. You have told me previously, in respect of other lights on Kidnappers that you are not responsible (because a contractor has responsibility). You have then closed the reports. I then have to email you, you chase the contractor and it gets fixed. Can we please just jump to the version where you contact the contractor and the lamp gets fixed. Many thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Kidnappers Lane, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8423843&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
