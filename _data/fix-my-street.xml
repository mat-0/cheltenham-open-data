<title>Residents need further detailed info on forthcoming works, 17th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7723588</link>
<description>The village of Shipton has been advised of resurfacing works in the village from Tuesday 24th June 2025 until Friday 4th July 2025 but requires further details, for example: 1. will the whole area be closed off for the 9 days or will this be done in stages? 2. If the latter, what is the schedule/sequence? 3. Where are residents in the affected areas to park during the works? 4. How will residents in the affected areas gain access to their properties during the works? (some residents have properties only accessible via the main road. They have no access via a pavement or via alternative routes to their premises). 5. What will happen about the school bus services? How will children be collected if the school bus is unable to get through the village. 6. What will happen if vehicles are left in the affected areas? (for example by a visitor who has no sight of the works) 7. What will happen about private deliveries being attempted to residents&amp;#39; premises?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Residents are very keen to work with the Highways department to minimize disruption and delays to the works and this can be best supported by providing better details in advance.

<title>The drain is blocked problem, 17th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7723225</link>
<description>Customer reports that the drive has collapsed (this is the fourth time); they believe that the sand underneath has been undermined by water flow/run-off from the Highway which has entered the drain on their drive and flooded it (a builder has had to reinforce the drain&amp;#39;s wall with concrete). STW have logged this, but do not have a category/are inferring it is not their issue. The customer asks if there are any site plans available for drainage in the location and requests that an officer contact them and arrange a site inspection with them in attendance. &#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7723225&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Footpath is overgrown with grass/nettles and weeds. Crossing point, with textured paving for visually impaired is 90 per cent covered with soil and foliage. Extremely difficult to see cars speeding round the corner. The footpath has been marked up with spray paint saying 300m but that was several weeks ago and nothing has been done. This is the path used by many to take children to school and car drivers are unable to see them crossing the road until the last minute., 17th June</title>
