<title>Street light not working, 17th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8309534</link>
<description>Hi, I reported street lights not working and recieved a sassy response telling me it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Cheltenham Council&amp;#39;s light&amp;quot;. They say ALL street lighting is your responsibility (see attached screenshot of their website) and have no way to report it to them. The car parking spaces belong to them, not the public street lights. Im currently walking to and from the car in the dark and early hours which is dangerous for me and also risks my car being broken into / stolen. Can you suggest how this can be fixed? As CBC have stated Gloucestershire Council are responsible for ALL street lighting in Cheltenham.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8309534.0.jpeg?541d813f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 19, Hewlett Road, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8309534&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Flags attached to lampposts illegally with racist motivations. This is a serious issue and it is concerning that the council have allowed these flags to stay up for so long. If the flags were placed there by the council for an event this could be understood however it was done by vandals with racist motivations during protests across the country. Please respond to this quickly., 17th October</title>

<title>Difficulty getting out of Goldsmith Road/Pirton Fields., 17th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8309391</link>
<description>The estate entrance has extremely sharp turns, and the oncoming traffic on both sides is always coming at over the speed limit. The entrance used to be much easier to navigate as it had wider turns. There have been multiple car crashes in at this location in the past year because of this change.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Goldsmith Road, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8309391&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Multiple potholes and inadequately repaired surface., 17th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8309287</link>
<description>Harp hill downslope of Stanley Road. The surface, particularly heading down the hill, is downright dangerous - forcing cars to take dangerous avoiding action, driving in middle of the road on narrow, blind bends. Individual, poorly executed patching is not sufficient. This area of road is long overdue resurfacing and it is scandalous that many other less badly damaged, less busy, less dangerous roads continue to be resurfaced without any action here.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Harp Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8309287&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Damaged footpath/verge, 17th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8309275</link>
<description>On the corner of the entrance to Noverton Avenue there is an overgrown prickly bush on one side and worn verge where people are forced to walk to the side of the pavement to avoid being scratched by the bush. When there has been rain the muddy bit gets slippery so the bushy overgrowth needs cutting well back to enable safe walking on a solid pavement.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8309275.0.jpeg?0c7e1e69&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 7a, Noverton Avenue, Noverton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8309275&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Traffic light sequence, 17th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8309136</link>
<description>Traffic entering Churchdown cannot turn right into Pirton Lane because the right turning lane has been removed. This is backing up and disrupting the A40 Hamburger roundabout. It’s chaos. It worked perfectly with the roundabout, but the current sequencing allows only one or two vehicles through the lights (because everyone is trying to turn right) each turn. You need to adjust the sequence to provide long periods of traffic from single entry points to the junction to resolve the issue. Or reinstate the very effective roundabout.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8309136&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Broken road surface, 17th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8308182</link>
<description>Recent repairs have failed to address and resolve the safety issues on this roundabout. The road surface is in a very poor state with broken tarmac and differing levels of the road surface. This is very dangerous for cyclists and creates trip hazards for those on foot. This roundabout requires urgent work to make it safe to use, really frustrating that when Fairview Rd was resufaced the opportunity to repair the roundabout wasn&amp;#39;t taken. The very recent repairs failed to address the issues and are failing already. Do we need a serious or fatal accident before action is taken?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, All Saints&#39; Road, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8308182&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
