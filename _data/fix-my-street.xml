<title>Large mature tree posing significant safety risk to property and pedestrians, 16th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8304253</link>
<description>I am writing to raise serious concerns about the large, mature tree located directly outside my property at 65 London Road, Cheltenham, GL52 6HF. Over recent months, the condition of this tree has worsened and it now poses significant safety risks to both property and pedestrians. Several large branches and chunks of bark have already fallen, causing damage to cars parked nearby and creating dangerous obstructions on the pavement. In addition, a number of long hanging branches regularly hit against the front of my house and windows during periods of high wind, which is both alarming and potentially damaging to the structure of the property. I am also particularly concerned that the trees branches have become heavily entangled with the nearby electricity lines. This presents an additional and serious hazard that believe warrants immediate inspection and action. Given the potential danger to residents, vehicles and public footpaths, I request an urgent assessment of the trees condition and appropriate action to make the area safe.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 65, London Road, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8304253&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Once again I&#39;m reporting the problem with the rattling inspection cover, 16th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8303445</link>
<description>Location: The Reddings outside No&amp;#39;s 6 &amp;amp; 7 The Grange. The inspection cover which was replaced about a year ago is once again RATTLING every time a vehicle passes over it . This is very disturbing especially at night. It seems to be due to the design of these &amp;#39;split&amp;#39; covers which allows them to &amp;#39;rock&amp;#39; together with lack of maintenance.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8303445.0.jpeg?2bdc16de&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 7, The Reddings, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8303445&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
