<title>Broken and cracked asphalt on the pavement; broken and sunken kerbstones, and the whole thing a general mess!, 21st May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7600594</link>
<description>At the junction of the main Gretton Road and Gopshill Lane in Gretton, by the street sign for Gopshill Lane.

<title>Road is blocked completely with multiple vehicles and fencing,, 21st May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7600103</link>
<description>GL503JX Well Walk impassable this morning, as it has become a building site, I cannot access my building as it’s fenced off. I received no advance notice and have no information as to what is happening or how long it will last. The previous works here lasted years and damaged the cobbled road surface and drain in this street. The large heavy vehicles are causing damage to buildings &amp;amp; road surface.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7600103.0.jpeg?05b13abd&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 6, Well Walk, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7600103&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Customer has just been made aware of the works at the location (they saw a sign), but has received no prior notification. They state that this is going to cause them some inconvenience with visitors and a member of their household who works late into the evening.

<title>Unpermitted roadworks problem, 21st May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7598628</link>
<description>Customer has called and would like to raise some concerns regarding these WWU works. They have gone to use the footpath and approached the workers. The footway was closed and there was no prior signage, the workers were not helpful in engaging with the customer and has stated they were told to walk down the main road while a lorry was lifting large yellow pipes over the bridge. They said there was no clear alternative route for pedestrians and this is a regular school route and lots of children need access. Please can this be looked into and the customer will pursue this with WWU because of the way they have spoken to the MOPs. Customer did not wish to leave any personal details.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7598628&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>A cluster of small and numerous which have Stage4-5 ADB and need removal. They are just down from a blind bend.  If the trees fall without warning, they would not crush a car, but the traffic moves so fast around here, that there is a likelihood of big accident if a tree falls over the road. It is not a big stretch of road (100M).&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7598627&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>3-4 unavoidable potholes, 20th May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7597631</link>
<description>There are 3-4 large potholes that are becoming unavoidable due tho their growing size and position in the road. They are on the near side of the road when driving away from the main road (deeper into the cul-de-sac) Because of the parking of residents and the curvature of the road, they are now impossible to miss. Each time this road is ‘patched up’ - it is just that, only patched up and not repaired. There are stones that flick up and damage the cars as well as the ever returning pot holes. This entire road needs to be completely relayed- which hasn’t happened in the 10+ years I have lived here.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 2, Winton Close, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7597631&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Street lights have been off for about 3 weeks, 20th May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7597624</link>
<description>The street lights behind and surrounding my house have been out for approx 3 weeks. I am a young woman who regularly comes home after dark and due to the alley ways and grassy green across the way, it’s very nerve racking to be arriving home and going to the house from the car in the dark. It also makes parking/ turning around very difficult.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7597624.0.jpeg?fae4a836&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Winton Close, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7597624&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
