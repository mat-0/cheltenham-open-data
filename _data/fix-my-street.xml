<title>Innsworth lane and rookery road junction zebra crossing missing, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114834</link>
<description>Dear Sir/Madam,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to raise a serious safety concern regarding the junction of Innsworth Lane and Rookery Road. This area is used daily by hundreds of children attending Innsworth Junior School, along with parents, carers, and other pedestrians.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At present, there is no pedestrian crossing facility, such as a zebra crossing, at this busy junction. As a result, children are regularly forced to cross the road while vehicles approach at considerable speed. This creates a highly unsafe environment, particularly during school drop-off and pick-up times when traffic levels are at their highest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The absence of a designated crossing point poses a significant risk of accidents and injuries. Installing a pedestrian crossing would greatly improve safety, reduce the likelihood of incidents, and provide reassurance to families and residents who use this route daily.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I urge the council to give this matter urgent attention and to consider the installation of a zebra crossing or another appropriate traffic-calming measure at this junction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Innsworth Lane, Innsworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114834&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A40 roadworks/diversion, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114709</link>
<description>Chaos in Charlton Kings village. Proper signage needs to be employed stating &amp;#39;Local Access Only&amp;#39; &amp;amp; &amp;#39;No HGV access&amp;#39; whilst the roadworks are in place on the A40. We are only a matter of days into a potential very long term closure. It is only a matter of time before a serious incident occurs. Cars and lorries mounting pavements to get through. Long queues of traffic through the village. Children are now back to 3 schools in the vicinity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please please please organise this better... and Police it!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There has been months of run up to this closure. Diversions and signage have not been thought through adequately.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Chestnut Terrace, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114709&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Water Level in the drain seems High, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114528</link>
<description>The level of water in the drains seems high, usually when cleaned there is around 121 cm now it is around 40-50 cm and as we have previously had flooding of the road, driveway, footpath and the side of our house could both drains at the bottom of Roxton Drive be cleaned. Both drains out side of number 7 and number 6 if possible to clean may help to avoid being flooded again.

<description>We live in number 12. Our driveway is the lowest point and we are consistently getting flooded and it comes into the house. We have to manually remove water . Fortunately we were home but if not this would be a disaster. This happens when we have a sudden heavy downpour.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8114218.0.jpeg?efc03b76&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 10, Church Street, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114218&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Life-threatening traffic incidents, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114207</link>
<description>There are roadworks on the A40 and a road closure causing absolute carnage in Charlton Kings village, specifically East End Road. There are HGVs mounting kerbs, huge volumes of traffic blocked up in both directions, and kids dodging angry frustrated drivers. It is a matter of time until there is a terrible accident, especially with the schools returning tomorrow. There urgently needs to be signage around the works and at the start of the diversion, for example parking restrictions should have been put in place along both East End Road/Church Street/New Street/Horsefair Street, however frustrating and inconvenient that might be for residents who don&amp;#39;t have off road parking, a 7.5t weight limit in place (and enforced!) at the junction of the A40/East End Road, and no entry from the A40 into Herne Road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 42, Church Street, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114207&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Previous Work Causing Flooding, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114147</link>
<description>Hello, the previous job completed by the council at my address - GL53 9NN - has caused the flow of water going down the hill during heavy periods of rain to be diverted into my house. Instead of continuing down the natural drainage ‘V’ channel, the workers placed tarmac which caused the water to divert onto my drive and therefore towards my property.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This came to light today and very nearly caused my house to flood.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would appreciate if the council came to fix this matter urgently.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8114147.0.jpeg?1fceeee1&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cowley, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114147&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Increased use of access only road due to London rd closure, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114055</link>
<description>Lots of cars are now using School Road (which is access only) as a cut through due to London Road being closed for the bridge repairs. Given this road only had two passing points it’s causing traffic issues for residents (we are having lots of cars turning into our drive) and also pedestrians as cars are speeding down the road and the pavements are minimal or have cars parked on them. It’s dangerous especially with Balcarras back at school as it’s one of the main pedestrian routes. A sign at each end needs to be placed reminding cars it’s access only and not a suitable diversion.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 55, School Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114055&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
