<title>Pathway not reinstated properly after utility works, 5th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7667085</link>
<description>Hi team I&amp;#39;ve been advised that you are able to help with correcting the pathway in The Minster Churchyard Cheltenham.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We see that there has been some utilities work at the Well Walk end of the churchyard pathway. We see that the utility chaps have put down black tarmac on the pathway – rather than the carefully selected resin-type surface.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is also noted that the brickwork paving on Well Walk has been put down a little unevenly, but better than before. The double yellow lines have been reinstated. It was raised at the end of February that the whole of Well Walk needs attention, including the yellow lines which have largely disintegrated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I understood that GCC are responsible for the lighting and pathways in The Minster Churchyard, as GCC was involved in the recent project to rejuvenate the area. This was in conjunction with Cheltenham Borough Council, The Diocese of Gloucester and our Church Council.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you could look in to this - particularly the reinstatement of the original pathway surface to match. It should also be noted that any work in The Minster grounds need acknowledgement from the church as it is a closed churchyard and still contains burial remains.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kind regards Rachel&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7667085.0.jpeg?676b3c0f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Clarence Street, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7667085&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Customer is calling and says a telegraph post has been installed on the footway next to their property. They say it is close to their boundary wall and is looming over their property.

<title>Storm drain blocked between Green Cottage and the drainage ditch opposite, 5th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7666247</link>
<description>The drainage ditch to the rear of the Old Meeting House feeds into an underground pipe (Point A) that runs under the rear of Yew Tree Lodge and on to an access chamber to the rear of Green Cottage (Point B). I have &amp;#39;rodded&amp;#39; this section and it appears to be clear. I have attempted to rod from point B towards point C but the pipe is blocked approximately 24 metres from Point B. I believe the pipe should exit into the drainage ditch at Point C.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a result of this blockage the drainage ditch to the rear of The Old Meeting House fills and eventually floods The Old Meeting House, Green Cottage and the rear of Elm Lodge. This last happened in September 2024.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am aware that this issue has already been reported but I though it would be helpful to add some detail.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7666247.0.jpeg?cad6efb9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7666247&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Obstruction to visibility at the junction near High Groove Way, 5th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7665577</link>
<description>I am writing to raise concerns about the hedge at No. 1 Essex Close, GL31NZ, which has been planted illegally and is causing a serious obstruction to visibility at the junction near High Groove Way. This hedge has led to numerous near misses and is putting road users at unnecessary risk. After conducting thorough investigations, including reviewing property deeds and estate plans, it is clear that this hedge has been planted outside the property&amp;#39;s legal boundary for personal gain. The household at No. 1 Essex Close has no legal claim to estate land or council land, and this hedge must therefore be removed immediately. Drivers approaching this junction struggle to see oncoming traffic without having to dangerously edge their vehicles into the road. In addition, the presence of streetlights buried within the hedge clearly indicates that it extends beyond the property boundary and onto council land. The red fence behind the hedge further proves that the planting is outside the rightful boundary of the property. Under Section 154 of the Highways Act 1980, the council has the authority to require the removal or trimming of any vegetation obstructing visibility and causing a danger to road users. Part 8 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 also allows councils to take action where high hedges negatively impact public safety and enjoyment of a space. This is not just an inconvenience—it is a safety hazard that affects local residents and tax-paying motorists. The selfish actions of one household should not endanger others or make daily driving unnecessarily difficult. I urge the council to take swift and decisive action to remove this hedge and restore safe visibility at this junction. I look forward to your prompt response and to seeing the necessary steps taken as soon as possible.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7665577.0.jpeg?0b55dd74&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Highgrove Way, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7665577&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Trees are totally covering any sight of the traffic lights, 5th June</title>

<description>On the A40 the trees need to be taken right back further down the A40 from the Petrol Station to the traffic lights as it is impossible to see the lights until you reach them. There are large yellow warning signs advising lights in 400yds but most people miss them completely. The trees need to be cut at the top, not just the bottom section.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): A40, Andoversford, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7665057&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
