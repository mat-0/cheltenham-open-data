<title>Dangerous parking, 2nd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8367078</link>
<description>Vans are parking on both sides of the road here and creating a total bottle neck. Last week I was walking with my grandson on the pavement here and there was a very near miss when 2 cars travelling in opposite directions nearly collided when passing at the same time. The car skidded to a halt right next to my grandson!! The vans are there in morning and evening and its a matter of time until there is a bad crash. They take up almost an entire lane and theres no parking restrictions to keep this road safe. Please can someone investigate this before someone gets hurt. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8367078.0.jpeg?89c03a32&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 59, Court Road, Brockworth, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8367078&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
