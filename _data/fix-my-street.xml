<description>This was supposed to have been sorted in March but the road is flooded again, the drains are blocked and need to be cleared.

<title>Drain blocked, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114355</link>
<description>The drain immediately outside No. 1 Whitecross Square is almost completely blocked. I managed to free up two others using my umbrella, but the drain is obstructed too far down for this to be effective. Previous blockage of this drain caused major damage to the property.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 2, White Cross Square, Naunton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114355&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Flooding caused by blocked drains, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114218</link>
<description>We live in number 12. Our driveway is the lowest point and we are consistently getting flooded and it comes into the house. We have to manually remove water . Fortunately we were home but if not this would be a disaster. This happens when we have a sudden heavy downpour.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8114218.0.jpeg?efc03b76&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 10, Church Street, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114218&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Life-threatening traffic incidents, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114207</link>
<description>There are roadworks on the A40 and a road closure causing absolute carnage in Charlton Kings village, specifically East End Road. There are HGVs mounting kerbs, huge volumes of traffic blocked up in both directions, and kids dodging angry frustrated drivers. It is a matter of time until there is a terrible accident, especially with the schools returning tomorrow. There urgently needs to be signage around the works and at the start of the diversion, for example parking restrictions should have been put in place along both East End Road/Church Street/New Street/Horsefair Street, however frustrating and inconvenient that might be for residents who don&amp;#39;t have off road parking, a 7.5t weight limit in place (and enforced!) at the junction of the A40/East End Road, and no entry from the A40 into Herne Road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 42, Church Street, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114207&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Previous Work Causing Flooding, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114147</link>
<description>Hello, the previous job completed by the council at my address - GL53 9NN - has caused the flow of water going down the hill during heavy periods of rain to be diverted into my house. Instead of continuing down the natural drainage ‘V’ channel, the workers placed tarmac which caused the water to divert onto my drive and therefore towards my property.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This came to light today and very nearly caused my house to flood.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would appreciate if the council came to fix this matter urgently.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8114147.0.jpeg?1fceeee1&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cowley, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114147&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Increased use of access only road due to London rd closure, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114055</link>
<description>Lots of cars are now using School Road (which is access only) as a cut through due to London Road being closed for the bridge repairs. Given this road only had two passing points it’s causing traffic issues for residents (we are having lots of cars turning into our drive) and also pedestrians as cars are speeding down the road and the pavements are minimal or have cars parked on them. It’s dangerous especially with Balcarras back at school as it’s one of the main pedestrian routes. A sign at each end needs to be placed reminding cars it’s access only and not a suitable diversion.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 55, School Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114055&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Water flowing under gate into our property after heavy rain, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8113994</link>
<description>Junction of Blacksmiths Lane, Deep Street and Bouncers Lane. Water appears to flow down Blacksmiths Lane after heavy rain, then accumulate at the junction to a depth of several inches. Some of this water flows under our gate and into our back garden (the wooden gate visible in the photograph). We are fearful that if this continues there may be a risk of the house flooding too.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8113994.0.jpeg?200e5022&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 2, Deep Street, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8113994&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>A sign needs to be put here to tell HGV drivers to turn around and use the correct diversion route (due to the closed A40 / Hambrook bridge repairs) and that they must not travel through the village. The village is in chaos and the traffic poses a danger to pedestrians as traffic is using the pavements to get through. Children have returned to the three schools in the village and the volume of traffic is very dangerous&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 2, Woodgate Close, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8113841&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
