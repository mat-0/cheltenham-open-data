<title>The lane control approach sign is getting obscured again, 13th November</title>

<description>The lane control approach sign from Churchdown towards Elmbridge Court Roundabout (A40 / A417) is getting obscured again by vegetation. Southbound, from Churchdown. Could the greenery be trimmed back again please ? TIA ! [NOTE : I&amp;#39;ve recently raised this via this app under &amp;#39;vegetation&amp;#39;, but I think it went to Glos City Council / Ubico, who said it was not their jurisdiction, and closed the request]&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Elmbridge, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8416810&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Ridiculous road closure that has no purpose, 13th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8416604</link>
<description>Please remove the road closed - residents access only signs that appear in our road every time there are races at the racecourse. They were put in place on Tuesday for races that I assume start tomorrow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It serves no purpose - those who want free parking simply ignore it and come into the street and the traffic wardens cannot ticket them for doing so.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We have several delivery drivers who haven’t delivered claiming they couldn’t access the street as it was unsafe to do so. This has cost us money as we had tradesmen waiting for urgent next day deliveries that didn’t come.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I’ve asked repeatedly last year and this “what is the purpose of these signs” and received no response.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please come asap and remove them - they are nonsensical, ugly and have no purpose whatsoever. They are now causing delivery issues too.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 6, Kensington Avenue, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8416604&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
