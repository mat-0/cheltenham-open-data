<title>Graffiti on cream wall at side of a house, 21st August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8058439</link>
<description>The graffiti is on the wall of a house near the junction of Upper Bath Street with Bath Road. I have previously reported it through Fix my Street and, when I got an email asking if it had been fixed, I tried to say no. The system then told me I had already responded (which I hadn’t!). Needless to say, it hasn’t been fixed as you can see from the photos I took, this evening.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8058439.0.jpeg?c248f66f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 163, Bath Road, Naunton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8058439&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Flytipping of builders waste, 21st August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8058433</link>
<description>General builders waste, plaster and adhesive and chemicals are being tipped at the end of Wellington Lane and outside the wall of The Garden House and Rosehill. This started happening in the last couple of weeks and every day there is more waste appearing. It looks as if some is also putting waste down the rain water drains.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8058433.0.jpeg?a519ab27&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Wellington Lane, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8058433&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Outside 40 Ryeworth Road,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It was “inspected” a few weeks ago and deemed not dangerous enough. I’m sorry but that is unacceptable. My car (that I pay road tax for) cannot pass the dip now without bottoming out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It needs repairing, not when it gives way like 2 years ago, but now.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 37, Ryeworth Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8057788&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree very large, 21st August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8057614</link>
<description>Previous reference 7915696. I received an email today to say that the hazelnut tree reported has been done/cut. However, the wrong one has been done as you’ll see on my previous report. I told you that the tree was behind 358 and 360 London Road. The tree that appears to have been cut is along Chase Avenue. And I’ve said it’s actually in the cul-de-sac behind the houses on London Road (also classed as Chase Avenue) by the garages. So I’m afraid someone’s going to have to come back and cut the correct Hazlenut tree. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 356b, London Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8057614&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Damaged drain cover, 21st August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8057587</link>
<description>The cover has AGAIN been damaged by the grass cutters, I thought that I had reported it last Tuesday but I can&amp;#39;t see any reference to it. This is constantly being damaged in the same way because they just drive the mowers straight over it never checking it is all right. I was in the back of the house when it happened and heard the noise.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hayden Road, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8057587&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The whole stretch of Brockhampton Lane from the barriers to The Hyde lane end is in a terrible state. The road is extremely uneven. The most recent repairs are pathetic. There’s a length of tarmac been placed which in itself is extremely uneven, the edges have given way already and the huge dip beyond was untouched and the repair finished to that., 21st August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8057195</link>
<description>The section on the long straight is particularly uneven and when cycling you are compelled to go along the middle of the road. However recently cracks have opened in the middle of the road which are wide enough to swallow a cycle tyre. Highly dangerous and the same has happpened at the other side of the railway crossing. Is it not time this road was fully resurfaced? Many cyclists go along here in preference to the dangerous Hyde lane. This must be the worst road in Gloucestershire. Please do something!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Brockhampton Lane, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8057195&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
