<title>Trenches across the road after utility work, the eegs of which are deteriorating with age and heavy vehicles, potentially causing significant danger to cyclists, motorists and nearby property., 23rd May</title>

<description>Outside 151 Hewlett Road, extending the entire width of the carriageway on both sides of the junctions with Ariel Lodge Road and All Saints Terrace. This problem has also been reported to our County Councillor, with a copy to our MP. We believe that any solution to this problem should include a weight restriction on vehicles passing along Hewlett Road: their passage, particularly at speed, causes our house to shake.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 151, Hewlett Road, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7610111&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Confusing road marking causing traffic near-misses., 23rd May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7610038</link>
<description>North Street was recently resurfaced with new road markings. It is a two-way street but the white triangle in the road telling motorists to give way is painted in the centre of the road, giving drivers the impression it is a one way street. This means that some drivers are moving over to the right before turning and blocking the road for vehicles turning into North Street from the High Street. Surely the triangle should be on the left and there should be a single pecked white line in the centre of the road, leading to the double pecked white lines at the actual junction of the roads. I have witnessed several near misses in the last week or so, one involving a lorry. A couple of men who were measuring the road told me they just painted whatever was there before, but if that was the case, I guess it was so faded it didn&amp;#39;t cause a problem.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7610038.0.jpeg?3b8ca098&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 5, North Street, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7610038&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pedestrian button deactivates whilst waiting at lights., 23rd May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7609657</link>
<description>The location is on Hewlett Road, close to the Badhams Chemist. Shortly after a pedestrian calls for the light to change so that (s)he can cross the road safely, the green light on the button returns to red without activating the crossing (i.e. the request self-cancels). This appears to be an intermittent fault.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 89, Hewlett Road, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7609657&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Both 30mph speed limit signs are obscured by vegetation, 23rd May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7609415</link>
<description>When entering Cheltenham on the Cirencester Road, there are speed limit signs (on both sides of the road) either side of LillyBrook Golf Course of 40mph and 30mph. The 30mph signs on both sides of the road are obscured by vegetation. One is due to an over hanging tree and the other, on the other side of the road is completely covered by vegetation. During the recent resurfacing of this road, a lot of traffic calming paintwork has been applied to the road but this is undermined because drivers entering Cheltenham won&amp;#39;t see the 30mph speed limit signs.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7609415.0.jpeg?9dbd2824&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hartley Close, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7609415&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
