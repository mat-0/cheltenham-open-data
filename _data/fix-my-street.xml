<title>A pothole in road problem, 19th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8439221</link>
<description>&amp;#10;Good Evening.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The main road through Cowley to Elkstone (near the Green Dragon) is currently closed for resurfacing. Whilst a diversion has been put in place it’s is not actually able to deal with the traffic. The diversion is sending traffic from both sides of the closure along a narrow single track. Not only is this riddled with pot holes it does not allow for vehicles to pass in both directions. On two occasions today, this morning and later this evening, traffic became gridlocked as the diversion route cannot handle two way traffic. There are no wider sections to allow passing of vehicles going in opposite ways. Vehicles were backed up unable to move forward or backwards, with tensions getting high. I think Glos Highways need to reassess the diversion as it is totally inappropriate, dangerous and impractical.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kind regards&amp;#10;Katie Holder&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8439221&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Traffic lights causing gridlock every morning, 19th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8438297</link>
<description>The timings of the temporary traffic lights on Shurdington Road is causing gridlock every morning. They are left open on green for far too long, the traffic going towards cheltenham gets stuck at the Moorend park road lights and block the vehicles going the other way. That in turns blocks the traffic on Woodlands road to turn either way causing long queues. This morning was absolutely mayhem, cars going on pavements and wrong way around the vehicles blocked in lanes. This needs to be sorted, it has been going on for far too long and nothing is being done about it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shurdington Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8438297&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Electrical items dumped in Manor Road, Swindon Village, 19th November</title>

<description>Maybe if the Amenity Waste Centre in Swindon Road was still open, the person who dumped this electrical stuff in Manor Road would have driven half a mile further and disposed of this rubbish sensibly. There has noticeably been more flipping in our Village since the closure.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8438171.0.jpeg?9fabbb74&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 11, Manor Court, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8438171&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
