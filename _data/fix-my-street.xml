<title>Fly tipping, 30th May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7639151</link>
<description>Guess what?? More rubbish has been dumped here last night. The sofa and chair that were there for a week have now gone. But within 24 hours more rubbish arrives. Happens nearly every week and has done for years. Why do you do nothing to prevent it happening or to fine the people responsible?? It makes a fairly tatty part of town look like a rubbish dump.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 66, Pates Avenue, Alstone, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7639151&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Junction of Clarade Street and St Georges Place, 30th May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7637011</link>
<description>The junction here was recently relined, but the condition of the road surface wasn&amp;#39;t addressed. The uneven surface is a danger to all road users especially cyclists. Indeed the condition of the road surface along many stretches of Clarence Street is wholly inadequate and extremely undulating for all vehicle users. More needs to be done and if only each relevant department could communicate with one other it may help improve the condition of our roads and safety of those who use it.

<title>Overgrown tree - sticky sap, debris and scratches car, 30th May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7636413</link>
<description>Tree that has significantly overgrown above designated parking space number 34 on Brockweir Rd, Cheltenham GL52 5FP.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Large tree regularly drops sticky sap and debris onto vehicles, which not only obscures the windows by creating a solid sticky residue - creating a potential safety hazard, a slippery surface around vehicles when wet - but also damages the paintwork.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to the sap, overhanging branches have begun scratching car doors, to the extent that it is now required to park partially on the road to try to avoid further damage.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7636413.0.jpeg?f225c1d7&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 32;36;38;40;42;44;46;48, Brockweir Road, Oakley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7636413&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Other damage to pavement i.e. cobbles, raised mound/surface problem, 29th May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7634157</link>
<description>Customer reports that the pavement at the location is cracked and broken up and the water meter cover has sunk - it&amp;#39;s a trip hazard. STW were due to replace/repair/change the meter, but the sub-contractor on site yesterday advised that, whilst they had attended to other meters locally, they had no Streetworks permit to repair this one. Their overriding concern is the condition of the pavement and the potential safety hazard to pedestrians. They ask if Highways can investigate, as this affects the pavement.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7634157&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree getting increasingly high., 29th May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7632683</link>
<description>I‚Äôve expressed my concern before about the tree on the entrance to Linden Close bordering our property at 35 Linden Avenue. The tree roots are causing the pavement to lift (let alone what damage they may be causing to our house). But also the height of the tree is now quite alarming. I‚Äôve not had any success previously in having the tree removed (even though the one across the road has been taken down) but could I at least ask if the tree can be reduced in size. It is within distance of our house now if large branches or indeed the tree itself were to fall.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Linden Close, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7632683&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Blocking visibility on road/junction (Grass/verge) problem, 29th May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7632590</link>
<description>What appears to be a broken drainpipe and rodding point ? On the verge outside 14 Alverton Drive. Do not believe the verge is responsibility of GCC.  Can this be passed on to the AHR for the area for confirmation.

<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7632071</link>
<description>Clearly GCC do not have any idea of the state of roads and are not able to make judgements whilst on site. Some potholes were repaired at this location yesterday (28/5) and this was either missed or your system of identification and schedule of repair is an entire nonscience and waste of our tax payers money.
