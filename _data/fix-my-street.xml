<title>The worst parts of the damaged pavement has been repaired but there is damaged right next to the repairs which surely is just going to lift the repairs.I am assuming this is only a temporary repair? before the full pavement is repaired as over the years cable tv,STWA,British Gas and heavy vehicles have taken their toll on the pavement which has caused this patchwork of various tarmaced surfaces., 28th April</title>

<title>The problem is down our street, milliner crescent., 28th April</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7494206</link>
<description>Our road is used by inconsiderate/dangerous drivers. This has been an issue for over two years. There have been near misses with our children and pets a long this road. As you can see there’s no path way so pedestrians are at risk. Cars drive down these roads at 50mph as it’s a straight road causing residents to worry about their pets/children’s safety. This street needs speed bumps. On our portion field page a lot of people have complained , reported dangerous driving etc, but nothing changes. Something needs to be done.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7494206.0.jpeg?2465d8e8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Milliner Crescent, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7494206&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A pothole in road problem, 28th April</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7493791</link>
<description>Please could I notify you of a number of potholes outside of my property and the poor state of the carriageway.  I previously notified you of this issue back on the 05/09/2022 and the safety inspector felt they did not meet the criteria for being repaired.  However nearly 3 years on and they have gotten substantially worse…..to the point now that it is not only large lorries making my house jolt but now even cars.  The road surface itself is in poor condition for a distance of around 15 feet past my property towards the junction for Hewlitt Road.  Please could I get you to rectify this situation and make repairs as needed.  &#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7493791&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Traffic light facing shakespeare road - sensor needs checking ?, 28th April</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7491848</link>
<description>The Traffic light facing shakespeare road (PE Way / Coll / Chelt) was stuck on red today (28/4). We were the 2nd vehicle, a local person told me to roll forward a little to catch the sensor, which we did, and shortly afterwards the light changed. The lead vehicle had opted to do a U turn. Is it possible to check the motion/weight sensitivity of the sensor please ? Thankyou !&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Princess Elizabeth Way, Benhall, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7491848&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Good morning, a resident has reported to me that the bridge crossing the stream at this point is damaged. I have copied and pasted what he put in his message below. &amp;quot;Sorry to inform you that the first bridge across the brook has been damaged again . Two treads have been removed which are in the brook and the bridge is now quite dangerous.&amp;quot; If you need any other information please do not hesitate to contact me. Many thanks Lianne&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Mill Lane, Brockworth, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7491017&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
