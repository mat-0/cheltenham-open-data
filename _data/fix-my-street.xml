<description>All slip roads and the roundabout are covered in litter and rubbish. This is the first impression for visitors to Cheltenham and Gloucester and sets a poor precedent.

<title>Rubbish and litter along entire corridor of Gloucester Road., 19th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8313099</link>
<description>There is rubbish, litter and fly tipping along the entire corridor of the Gloucester Road. Particularly in the central reservation and by the Armco barrier near the BMW garage. Why is there no litter bin in the lay-by on the Cheltenham approach? This road and the junction with the M5 is a key gateway to both Gloucester and Cheltenham and the first impression for many visit both especially when key events are on and set ms a poor impression. Why is this corridor not tidied or cleaned on a consistent and regular basis?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): A40, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8313099&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Circa 8ft fallen tree branch on driveway of 42 Boverton Drive, 19th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8313017</link>
<description>Fallen branch fell on to property at 42 Boverton Drive adjacent to car. Branch had potential to fall onto pavement/pedestrian and cause injury. Branch has been relocated to verge for collection/inspection. As the tree is unmaintained and continues to encroach on properties it is recommended that the tree is inspected and cut back to mitigate future falling branchs which could damage property or cause injury to people.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 42, Boverton Drive, Brockworth, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8313017&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Need to review the repair at the top of the hill, 18th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8312611</link>
<description>Previous ref - Web Reference: 7884069 | Enquiry Number: 22082475 TWO large tarmac patch, this one, and one northbound at the top of the hill, both with leading lip edges that cause a violent jolt on the car/vehicle. This one still has a leading edge to it (FYI, the northbound one has a hump of new tarmac over it, which is NOT good enough and is making things worse - and I&amp;#39;ve raised a NEW separate report on it now). I had previously asked if these edges could be made lower or smoother. Can you PLEASE grind down the tarmac and make it level to the road surface ASAP. For both of these patches, Glos Highways will be liable for car suspension damage !!!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hucclecote Lane, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8312611&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>2 bus stop signs are missing along Delavale Road Winchcombe, The first one is about half w, 18th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8311953</link>
<description>Is about half the way along, next to what is now a tall fence, once a high hedge, on the left hand side and the second round a right bend, at a ditch, before the bus route turns left and down towards back lane. Without obvious bus stop signs it can be difficult to identify where and if people can catch a bus. A timetable on the stops would also be welcome, as there is a big new house estate being built along Delavale Road. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Back Lane, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8311953&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
