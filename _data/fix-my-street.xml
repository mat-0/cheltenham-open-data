<description>The traffic calming chicane on Gotherington lane. Whilst the vegetation has been cleared from one entry into the chicane, visibility from the other end is obscured by long grass and presents a risk to all road traffic.

<title>Traffic calming on Gotherington lane is dangerous, 4th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7662868</link>
<description>The Traffic calming on Gotherington lane is dangerous as the verges are not maintained on a monthly basis. It is not easy to see oncoming traffic....particularly if the vehicle is not tall. Seeing cyclists is also an issue. Please remove the traffic calming ASAP. It would be far safer to have just a speed camera. Thereby limiting speed, maintaining traffic flow and causing less pollution due to unecessary stop start.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gotherington Lane, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7662868&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree, 4th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7662498</link>
<description>I am writing to express my deep concern regarding a serious and ongoing issue I first reported on 13th June 2022 regarding a tree growing dangerously close to my roof. This poses an imminent danger to my family, especially during adverse weather conditions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Following my initial report, I received a response from Dorothy Coopey confirming that the work had been programmed to take place, under reference number 11368736. I followed up via email on 28th October 2022, but did not receive any reply.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On 20th December 2023, I was informed by Dawn Hanker that a new work order had been raised under reference number 43087666. However, to date, no action has been taken, and the tree continues to grow, increasing the risk to my family.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This delay of nearly three years is unacceptable, especially given that the danger was acknowledged and scheduled for action in 2022. The situation is now severely impacting my children&amp;#39;s mental health and education â€” they cannot study or sleep peacefully, and are often forced to sleep in the conservatory during strong winds due to fear of the tree falling.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I urge you to treat this matter with the urgency it deserves. If no action is taken promptly, I will be compelled to take legal action against the Highway Authority for negligence and the potential harm to my family&amp;#39;s well-being.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please confirm the issuance of an immediate work order and the expected date for the work to be completed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 18, Limber Hill, Wymans Brook, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7662498&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
