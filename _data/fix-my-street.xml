<title>Pot hole and state of road, 22nd November</title>

<description>This section of road has been patched several times. Another pothole has now appeared.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Why not do proper job of scraping out a good rectangle of all the separate filling and resurface the patch and be done with it for many years to come.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hucclecote Road, Hucclecote, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8451397&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Blocked drain causing pavement access, 22nd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8450687</link>
<description>As previously reported several months ago the same problems still exist. Heavy leaf litter in the gully is blocking the drain. The water regularly blocks access to the pavement for pedestrians, people with prams and those in wheelchairs etc. More regular street cleaning needs to be carried out following the annual autumnal leaf Wallace prior to heavy rains.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Photos won&amp;#39;t upload unfortunately&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Market Street, St Paul’s, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8450687&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Further re-lining required, 21st November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8450511</link>
<description>Related to ref 7820124, further re-lining required for the approach to Elmbridge Court Roundabout, from Churchdown. I had assumed it would have been completed by National Highways (in November 2025, when they re-painted the roundabout), but previous correspondence with GH and NH clarified to me that there is a clear boundary for jurisdiction, and so presumably GH would &amp;#39;own&amp;#39; this section of road that leads to the roundabout ? So could you check who owns that strip of road, and arrange for it to be repainted please ? Whilst the lane control sign is still obscured (see separate ticket raised by me), new paint work would really help in clarifying the correct approach lane to use :-) Thankyou !&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Churchdown, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8450511&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Road markings, 21st November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8450042</link>
<description>The roundabout connecting Hatherley Lane to Grovefield way near the new park and ride. On exit from Hatherley Lane there use to be a lane marked park and ride, on the right, which has since been removed. I feel people are confused which of the two lanes to use to exit the 3rd exit to Grovefield Way.it used to be marked park and ride but has been blacked out. It is the obvious lane to use to exit onto Grovefield Way. The other day I was nearly in a RTA because as I moved over to exit, after checking my mirrors and signalling a car took issue with me using that lane and speeded to pass in front of me on the left hand side. I had to brake to let him pass. Words were exchanged saying I was in the wrong lane. In the end we agreed to disagreed. This seems to be an issue with other road users too. I think to mark the lane would clarify things rather than wait for accident to happen. If the lane is specifically for the park and ride or not.
