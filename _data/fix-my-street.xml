<title>Excessively long grass and weeds, Still not cut. DESPITE BEING REPORTED AS FIXED, 21st June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7742480</link>
<description>Repeat request.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Original request (web ref 7595888 &amp;amp; enquiry no. 22078665) was acknowledged 20/6/25 ..&amp;quot; Excessively long grass and weeds&amp;quot;. Excessively long grass and weeds, limiting visibility, in a busy parking area. It is near the School, so a particular problem for school-children drop-off &amp;amp;pick-up. Others have reported to Tewkesbury BC, and been informed that Glos CC Highways now has grass-cutting responsibility for this area. Could you confirm this, and when it is likely to be cut. Concerned residents can then be informed. Thank you..&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is very evident that this has not been fixed as the grass has not been cut. Could you please provide a more considered (not automated) response, thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gretton Road, Gretton, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7742480&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>3 signs advising Rd Rd closure 5 miles away in Winchcombe, 21st June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7742197</link>
<description>25 yds on Southam Rd (B,4632) after turning off High St Prestbury. 3 signs referred to above blocks the lane. Being such a short distance from turn, this has serious potential to cause an accident. A similar sign a short distance away and another at the turning for Woodmancote giving 4 miles are surely adequate and are more safety located off the carriage way. These signs are placed at random times moreso in evenings&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Southam Road, Noverton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7742197&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>One side of Everest Road and pavement closed for storage, 21st June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7742162</link>
<description>The first few metres of one side Everest road as you turn off Old Bath Road has been closed now for weeks. It is very dangerous as it creates a blind corner on a busy cut through from Charlton Kings to Leckhampton. There are no actual works going on here. Wales and West are using this as a storage facility. Why can&amp;#39;t this be moved somewhere safer? There are plenty of cul de sacs off the Old Bath Road. This has been poorly thought through. as a resident I have witnessed some very dangerous driving, especially at school pick up and drop off times caused by impatience and the inconvenience this unnecessary blockage is creating.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7742162.0.jpeg?4af638fd&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 16, Charnwood Road, Leckhampton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7742162&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>The temporary traffic light is showing green too early for those coming into Cheltenham on the A46. The lights go green for those on Kidnappers Lane, and as you&amp;#39;re driving down the road (as one of the first cars) you can see that it&amp;#39;s already green for those on the A46. I&amp;#39;ve seen this 3 times, and it always seems to be that the A46 is going green too soon for those heading north.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shurdington Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7741119&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
