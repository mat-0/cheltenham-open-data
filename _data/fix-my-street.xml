<title>W&amp;W works blocking one side of Everest Road, 13th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7704126</link>
<description>This leads to people mounting the pavement to avoid collisions. I witnessed a driver reverse, narrowly avoiding pedestrians attempting to cross the road behind them, because a car was coming the other way. Cyclists, pedestrians and drivers alike are in danger because this road is entirely blocked and there&amp;#39;s no way to see round the blockage. No work is being undertaken at this area apart from a big hole being fenced off several weeks ago. Repeated reports to W&amp;amp;W have led to absolutely nothing. Traffic management needs to be put in place before someone is hurt. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that vehicles are parking behind this, sometimes on the double yellows, which makes it even more of a hazard.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7704126.0.jpeg?3ddd9f65&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 38, Everest Road, Naunton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7704126&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>It would seem that this hole should be replaced with a stone or cement type material block. Previously there was a large blob of tarmac fitted there. -it has been left on the side of the road next to the trunk of the large tree, 13th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7703789</link>
<description>This hole is at the left hand corner of Priory Place (see 2 views as per photos) where it meets London Road. It is potentially dangerous for cyclists exiting Priory Place and the lack of material there will not id the longevity of the edge of the tarmac on London Road. This has only been a problem since the resurfacing of London Road this year.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7703789.0.jpeg?816dc986&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Priory Place, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7703789&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>This pothole has been fixed at least 3 times and every time the work is rubbish, beyond a joke. You had the cheek to email that you fixed this on 05/06/2025, well it&amp;#39;s not been fixed, same as the last time you came along chucked some grit in it and then left with a smug smile on your face of a job not well done. How many times can you mess up filling a hole in the ground!????&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Send a real inspector to look at what our taxes are being wasted on, this is beyond a joke!!!!!!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 54, Elm Street, Wymans Brook, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7703243&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>As you enter the Old Stoke Road immediately on your left are some over hanging branches. As a resident I use this route every day in my car, however, on Wednesday I drove my daughters brand new Motor Home on the same line and hit the overhanging branches which damaged paintwork and windows.
