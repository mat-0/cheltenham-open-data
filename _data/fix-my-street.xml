<title>There is safety/security Heras type fencing on the footway north from the junction of Leckhampton Lane which is causing a significant loss of visibility splay for traffic turning right. The fencing has been in place for some months while the garage is being rebuilt and large areas of the fence are covered by advertising banners obscuring the sight line. Initially it did not cause a problem but recently it was moved towards the roadway to facilitate the building of a new boundary wall which severely limited the view for vehicles turning north onto Shurdington Road. An image of this original position is included for completeness. I took this up with the owner of the site Mr Peter Davidson as owner of Shire Cars (contact details on the banners and online). He arranged for the fence to be moved back a little which helped significantly but it is still necessary to edge into the Shurdington Road to gain a satisfactory view of oncoming traffic when turning right. To quantify whether my expectations were unreasonable I made measurements of the visibility splay in accordance with Manual for Streets 2 chapter 10 and it was limited to around 27m. The SSD for this section of 30 mph road is at least 42m (graph p76) and more for a realistic 85% speed which should be used in the calculation. The junction is between the A46, one of the busiest roads in the county, and a very busy side road with peak flows of several hundred vehicles per hour in recent surveys made for some new developments. The junction is sufficiently high risk to have an antiskid surface applied on the Shurdington Road southbound approach. From the state of the construction work it is clear that the fencing will be in place for several more months. The owner has refused to make further changes to the fencing â€“ from my calculations even just moving the fencing to the centre hole on the support feet would give a splay of 50+m. There is no record on One.network of a licence being granted and no licence is displayed. To resolve the situation I request with the owners agreement that Gloucestershire Highways should investigate and regularise the whole situation. A secondary issue is that the footway is restricted to well below 1m along the Shurdington Road and around the corner and where the full width is available it is frequently blocked with parked site vehicles forcing pedestrians to walk on the road or cross over. The owner considers that his suggested benefits to motorists outweigh the specific requirement in the Template Traffic Management Plan and he reports that he has agreed this with Tewkesbury Building Control., 12th August</title>

<title>Right turn arrow not activating, 11th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8011380</link>
<description>There is a right turn arrow light that is not activating. This means that there is often a lot of traffic queuing in the right lane, but as the cycle never gives them priority against oncoming traffic, only one or two cars can get through at a time. This means there is often a long queue of cars in the right turn lane that blocks the traffic trying to go straight ahead too.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have seen this arrow turn on once or twice, shortly after the lights were turned on. But I&amp;#39;ve not seen it since, and certainly not when it&amp;#39;s busy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I&amp;#39;d be grateful if this could be investigated, and if you could confirm if this is the intended behaviour or not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 159, Cheltenham Road, Longlevens, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8011380&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
