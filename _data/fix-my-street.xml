<title>Filter light not working, 21st November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8446858</link>
<description>After repairing manhole yesterday, the filter light hasn’t been turned back on causing lengthy queues. Lights are also not on long enough to let a reasonable amount of traffic through causing traffic to back up onto Elmbridge court roundabout at peak times which is dangerous. Also, please can highways clear away all their signs, barriers and sandbags which have been abandoned all over the pavements in the area now works have been completed on those parts of the roads.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8446858&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Very large and UNEXPECTED dip in the road, 21st November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8446629</link>
<description>I have listed this as a pothole as there are no options for this problem.If you are travelling along Up Hatherley Way,Cheltenham towards Morrisons from the little roundabout at the end of Grovefield way there is a large UNEXPECTED dip in the road which takes motorists by surprise as it is mainly concealed.This is very dangerous for cyclists especially.If nothing is done the n the dip will undoubtedly turn into a large pothole AREA.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cold Pool Lane, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8446629&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Turning right, 20th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8444289</link>
<description>Turning right onto greyhound gardens is a nightmare since the bike lane has been installed, you can be sat at this junction for 10 mins, literally waiting for the ste of lights to change at least 4 times before you even get chance to go through. When you are not able to get through due to the amount of cars coming from cheltenham road heading towards the Elmbridge roundabout roundabout is just too much. this causes back log onto the roundabout also. If not, could the traffic coming from cheltenham road heading towards Elm bridge court roundabout, could their light stop at red and allow the traffice coming from the roundabout to carry on through for a bit longer would literally solve this problem if a filter light could not be added.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Its becoming dangerous as cars are having to go through red light while sat in the yellow box and cyclists and pedatrisains trying to cross over ther road not seeing the cars, espcially since it has now become very dark at night, these lights need a filter light even if it was for 10 seconds for cars entering greyhound gardens and nine elm bridge road. Please can this be looked at again this issue and resolved.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Nine Elms Road, Elmbridge, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8444289&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
