<title>Ringway barriers on the pavement, 10th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8277613</link>
<description>It appears that a section of the pavement in Wellington Square has been resurfaced (which is much appreciated) but the barriers have been left by Ringway for several weeks. I know there are tree roots which are causing the surface to be raised, so if there is additional work to be done here that is good - but if not please get the barriers removed as they are blocking the pavement.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Wellington Square, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8277613&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
