<title>Dog poo bags left beside road, 27th May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7622301</link>
<description>Whittle Garden is New Estate and most property is occupied now. This area is becoming popular for Dog walker as itâ€™s near by is wide open fields and fishing pond. Unfortunately some Dog owners are not taking away their dog fouling with them. sometimes throwing the poo bag on the grass besides foot path/ bridle way making it real messy. I request to install few dog fouling bins all along the Centurion road and on the bridle way connecting Whittle Garden and Twigworth Green.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Centurion Road, Innsworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7622301&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Bollard at the end of Church Street just in side The Minster Churchyard. It&amp;#39;s stuck and won&amp;#39;t operate properly, meaning the way is clear for vehicles to drive into churchyard. If this could be attended to as soon as possible that would be great.

<title>Suspected collapsed Drain, 26th May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7619307</link>
<description>The road has giant dips in it in several places that cause cars to bottom out as they are so deep. This is probably connected to the blocked drain issue.so perhaps you should get Severn Trent to take care of the problem if not under your remit. This could have been done the same time as resurfacing on London road a few weeks ago !!!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 50, Keynsham Street, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7619307&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Another pot hole in our lane, 26th May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7618049</link>
<description>What three words reference: thanks.hurry.craft&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is the last photo of my multiple submission but they are by no means the only holes in the lane. In the past pot holes have been overfilled which has created their own problems. The lane has not been resurfaced for over 30 years and with a neighbour falling in one, it is now becoming a health and safety issue. There is a very poorly lady living towards the end of the lane who is undergoing treatment and finds the journey extremely uncomfortable. We might be a small lane but there are a lot of people that use it so the WHOLE lane not just patches needs to be resurfaced. I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7618049.0.jpeg?c4a781ab&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lowdilow Lane, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7618049&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
