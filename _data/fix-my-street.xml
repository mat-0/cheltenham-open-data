<title>Yellow boxes required, 14th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295564</link>
<description>Yellow boxes are required on this roundabout to prevent the blocking of the flow of traffic. Currently traffic following the A40 east bound will block the traffic from PE way trying to travel west and traffic from PE way often blocks traffic travelling east on the A40. The current flow without yellow boxes results in a bad design that causes unnessesary congestion.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Benhall Roundabout, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295564&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Merge in turn signage required, 14th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295542</link>
<description>There needs to be clear signs here indicating to use both lanes and merge in turn at the merge point. Currently the right lane fills up and backs up onto the roundabout as drivers will either avoid use of the left lane or stop in the left lane 100m short of the actual merge point. This pushes traffic back onto the Benhall Roundabout, blocking traffic coming from PE Way.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gloucester Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295542&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Left lane should become a bus lane with more efficient lane layout., 14th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295501</link>
<description>The left lane with the bus stand should be made a bus only lane with the bus stop. The center lane should be the only lane for normal traffic to progess forward. Where the lanes merge on the west side of the juncion should be clearly marked as two lanes, the right lane should be where the center lane approaching from the east merges with the proposed bus lane. The new right lane on the west of the junciton would be for vehicles emerging from the B4633 (Gloucester Road) to join the A40 without blocking the junction. These two lanes should be separated with a solid line until a merge point just before the end of the central reservation. This would allow traffic to flow forwards more smoothly, stop near misses causes by the current 30m of two lanes immediately merging again, and allow traffic to joint from the B4633 without blocking the junction. A yellow box should be put in the east bound lane of the A40, infront of the entrance and exit lanes to the B4633.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lansdown Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295501&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>This bus stop should be removed, 14th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295462</link>
<description>There are alternate bus stops less than 300m in either direction of this stop. This road is too busy to accomodate an in-carriageway bus stop. Especially at peak times, buses stopping here will cause traffic jams, delays and increased polution. This bus stop should be removed and work carried out on ticket 8295452 to provide a better stopping point off the main carriage way. This would reduce commute times, reduce conjestion and polution on what is already a very busy road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gloucester Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295462&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bus stop causing traffic during peak hours, 14th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295452</link>
<description>This bus stop should be moved off the main carriage way by widening the road to accomodate a bus stop in the large verge area. It causes knock on effects and traffic jams every time a bus has to stop here during peak hours. Traffic is forced to stop and wait, causing it to built up whilst the bus is stationary at the stop. This leads to increased polution caused be stationary and stop start traffic. It also has an impact on the local economy by increasing commute times.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gloucester Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295452&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Completely pointless 3 way lights past permitted time, 14th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295335</link>
<description>Seven Trent water has completely pointless 3 way lights at this section. This can be seen because there is no work being carried out in the road and the pavement still has room to pass. There are crossing points that could easily be used if the pavement needed to be closed. I raised this with ticket 11496402 this morning at approx. 09:20. I was told the works would be cleared by 15:30. at 16:30 they were still in place, no actual work being carried out, and causing large traffic jams in both directions on the A40. These lights should never have been permitted in the first place. Seven Trent should be fined for inappropriately closing a lane, pointless use of 3 way lights and overstaying their permit.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8295335.0.jpeg?580f58f4&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 388, Gloucester Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295335&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
