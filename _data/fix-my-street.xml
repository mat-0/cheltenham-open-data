<title>Flooding NOT fixed by remedial work - only marginally less bad, 12th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8410909</link>
<description>The drain has not been moved. It is still in the WRONG place. I see the levels have been changed a little. Unfortunately that has NOT fixed the flooding. The water continues to pool at the pedestrian crossing. The pedestrian crossing is STILL used by hundreds of children every school day. The children (as you can see) can either be splashed by passing traffic due to flooding and wade through the MASSIVE puddle or they can move on the cycle path (where the drainage is fine). This WILL led to an accident involving children and bikes. I have been raising this issue for a year. I am NOT going to drop it, so you might as well get you contractors to FIX the problem PROPERLY.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8410909.0.jpeg?a18fa807&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Central Cross Drive, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8410909&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
