There are several drains, but just THIS ONE has dropped, and it&amp;#39;s making a very loud rattle. Hopefully that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s about to collapse ?! It&amp;#39;s in the left hand side of the main highway so traffic CANNOT avoid it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Pirton Lane, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8427195&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
