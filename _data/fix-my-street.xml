<title>Increased use of access only road due to London rd closure, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114055</link>
<description>Lots of cars are now using School Road (which is access only) as a cut through due to London Road being closed for the bridge repairs. Given this road only had two passing points it’s causing traffic issues for residents (we are having lots of cars turning into our drive) and also pedestrians as cars are speeding down the road and the pavements are minimal or have cars parked on them. It’s dangerous especially with Balcarras back at school as it’s one of the main pedestrian routes. A sign at each end needs to be placed reminding cars it’s access only and not a suitable diversion.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 55, School Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8114055&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Water flowing under gate into our property after heavy rain, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8113994</link>
<description>Junction of Blacksmiths Lane, Deep Street and Bouncers Lane. Water appears to flow down Blacksmiths Lane after heavy rain, then accumulate at the junction to a depth of several inches. Some of this water flows under our gate and into our back garden (the wooden gate visible in the photograph). We are fearful that if this continues there may be a risk of the house flooding too.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8113994.0.jpeg?200e5022&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 2, Deep Street, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8113994&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>There are a number of items of furniture that have been abandoned in Cypress Garden and Evergreen walk.

<title>Sign required re road closure, 3rd September</title>

<description>A sign needs to be put here to tell HGV drivers to turn around and use the correct diversion route (due to the closed A40 / Hambrook bridge repairs) and that they must not travel through the village. The village is in chaos and the traffic poses a danger to pedestrians as traffic is using the pavements to get through. Children have returned to the three schools in the village and the volume of traffic is very dangerous&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 2, Woodgate Close, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8113841&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Drain is blocked again!, 3rd September</title>

<description>On the corner of portland street outside of the cotswold inn the flooding is almost to my frontage and at risk of flooding my cellar bar. My customers are also getting soaked by the buses that come past regularly and plow through the huge puddle. I have to report this issue every year and every time I am told these drains are clearly regularly however I know for a fact that they are not as I live on site and and here every day and they are ALWAYS blocked.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8113628.0.jpeg?e77c2b57&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 17, Portland Street, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8113628&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Inadequate drainage leads to driveway flooding, 3rd September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8113611</link>
<description>We live in number 30. When it is heavy rain there is no drains between our property and the corner of the green on Barnmeadow Road. Our driveway is the lowest point and we are consistently getting flooded. It has almost come in to the house twice if not for us manually removing water with buckets and opening the drains. The water has go past our property to hit two drains so if it is heavy rain we are flooded. This is a huge risk - luckily I have been working from home the last few times but if it happens while I am out our house will flood. This has been happening for a few years now.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8113611.0.jpeg?60cc4dac&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Barnmeadow Road, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8113611&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>This manhole has constantly issues. Last year I was told it’s not blocked, but clearly it is.
