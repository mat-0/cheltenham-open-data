<title>Flooding outside door as you have not fixed a tarmacing error from almost 2 years ago. Which created a ditch for water to sit in. The assessor came at beginning of this year to say will be done by next April 2026? Is that normal. I think not. I will have to take legal action against Gloucestershire Highway for not taking my concerns seriously enough. Nobody should have to wait almost 2 years to rectify a problem caused by your contractors., 14th November</title>

<title>Drains need cleaning asap., 14th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8420395</link>
<description>As others have prevouisly stated the drains next to the school on both sides of the road are blocked. Staff used a pole to get one drain to clear a little but it needs a jet wash. Today I was soaked, it went over my head, by a pickup truck speeding through the puddle while I waited at the bus stop. I was just glad that there were no children waiting with me at the time. &amp;quot;Multiple drains outside Swindon Village Primary School are blocked causing a large build up of water into the road. Traffic not slowing down or going around the huge puddle is causing children and parents being soaked on the footpath&amp;quot;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Church Road, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8420395&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>To take an individual photo will not show the extent of the problem.Since the temporary closure of the A40 at Charlton Kings the road from Whittington to Aggs Hill is experiencing far too much traffic by people using it as a shortcut to Cheltenham making it unbearably busy and with little thought to local people .The road is collapsing in many places along with the verges.As a matter of some urgency repair work will be necessary once normal traffic resumes with the re-opening of the A 40 once the bridge repairs are completed ., 14th November</title>

<title>Enfield Road &amp; pavements needs resurfacing, 14th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8419822</link>
<description>Good afternoon my name is Mr. Gilbert. I live on Elmfield Road Cheltenham GL51 9JJ. The road and the pavement on Elmfield Road are absolutely worn out and needs servicing not just repairing potholes. The whole road is worn out. It is now that bad with some of our friends Refused to come down the road because of the damage it does to their cars. I know you’re probably pretty pushed at the moment I have reported this before but nothing‘s been done. The road is completely worn out. I’ve lived here 20 years and it’s never been resurfaced so please would somebody come and look at it? Enfield Road feed Saint Peter School there is an awful lot of traffic between 840 and 910 and 340 and 310 probably doesn’t help. Would someone get back to me and let me know what’s happening? My number is 07836354401 Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1;3;5;7;9;11, Sun Street, Wymans Brook, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8419822&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>This year there was a tree survey carried out by the highways agency on a copper beech tree outside 24E and 24F Moorend road, Cheltenham.  Talking to both the highways representative and tree assessment official after the assessment, they indicated that the tree would need its canopy severely reduced or felled completely due to the worsening condition of the tree (it has 2 large holes in it&amp;#39;s trunk at the base of the canopy).&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8418471&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
