<title>Abbey Terrace Dangerous Surface for mobility user, 28th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7940642</link>
<description>Resident Reported The pavement along Abbey Terrace needs some TLC, particularly the entrance to The Abbey where it crosses the pavement. I am a mobility scooter user and find the uneven surface difficult to navigate. The problem with the surface arose a year or so ago when substantial works were carried out at The Abbey and the many heavy lorries used in the building work created two distinct ruts across the pavement. I had expected that some remedial work would be carried out in due course but this does not appear to be the case. Using the pavement yesterday evening caused my scooter to lean at a frightening angle and at one point I really thought that it would tip over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can you please ask the powers that be to inspect the area and carry out some repair work.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Abbey Terrace, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7940642&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Someone tresspassed into stole my garden and stole my clean bin claarly marked 28a Oakleaze and left theiir dirty bin in my garden, 28th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7940617</link>
<description>Myself and mt wife were away for the weekend. Someone sneaked into my garden and left their dirty disgusting bin. They took my clean bin which clearly has a sticker for 28a Oakleaze. They filled it to the brim with their dirty child&amp;#39;s disgusting nappies and rotten milk, and tried to cover it. I feel distressed and violated. Understand they might have difficulties, but that is not my issue. Absolutely disgusting and theft.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7940617.0.jpeg?7b9581d0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 39, Oakleaze, Elmbridge, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7940617&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>ADE 60 Bridge missing and route impassable, 27th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7940350</link>
<description>ADE60 at SO 87919 27610 passes over a wide drainage channel. It is totally overgrown and impassable, but there is no bridge so it would be impassable even if the vegetation was cleared. However, there is a way around by going through a gate at Grid Ref: SO 87784 27593 which does have a way mark on the gatepost. Assuming that there no cash in the GCC coffers for a new bridge the current informal route should be designated as the PROW by a DMMO.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7940350.0.jpeg?c045643d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Pancake Lane, Leigh, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7940350&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Extremely long grass and weeds blocking vision and looking extremely untidy., 27th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7939845</link>
<description>Whole length of Finlay Way, traffic islands on and verges on either side of Bishops Cleeve By-pass. Dangerous for motorists given that high grass blocks visibility and to pedestrians - especially small children. Helping to create health issues for those of us who suffer from allergies to grass and weed pollen. It is also an utter disgrace that our village now looks so uncared for and scruffy when Cleeve must be one of the biggest contributors to Council Tax across the county. Disgusting. We need the verges cut regularly as in nearby Cheltenham which looks beautiful in comparison.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Finlay Way, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7939845&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Footpaths ASH 8 &amp; ASH 9 impassable, 27th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7938720</link>
<description>Junction of footpaths and for some distance leading to that junction. I tried to use the PROW from Hatherley Cricket Club to pick up the footpath which should run from Leckhampton Lane to Shurdington Rd this morning. When I came near to the &amp;#39;T&amp;#39; junction of these paths it was impossible to find a way through. I retraced my steps to the Cricket club and came along the A46 to try and find the path from the Shurdington Rd end. Again I was thwarted by vegetation. This is the second time this year I have reported the state of these paths and I see that at least one other person has reported it. This path is an important route for people wishing to avoid the busy A46 and it is a legal right of way. I would appreciate an early site visit from your representatives and proper reinstatement of these footpaths. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Leckhampton Lane, Shurdington, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7938720&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
