<title>Damage to stone bridge, 12th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7698717</link>
<description>The bridge crosses the River Isbourne at the end of Mill Lane GL54 5LT. It belongs to us at Millfield. It is about 150 years old and was built to carry horses and carts.I have been told that a sensible limit on weight would be 3 tons; this is the limit that we and our neighbour (who also has access) apply for any vehicles. However the stone bridge parpet has been damaged (please see photo) and the advice I have is that this has been caused by overloading. I suspect that the reason is that the bridge has been used by increasingly large and heavy vehicles accessing the King George V playing field which belongs to Winchcombe Town Council. At a guess the large tractor with gang mower attached must weigh 10 tons. I&amp;#39;m worried about the safety of the bridge so I&amp;#39;m going to put an additional padlock on, the current one neediing a County key. I&amp;#39;ve spoken to two builders who are considering if they can help with a repair and I&amp;#39;ve also talked to the Winchcombe Town Council reporting the problem. Your help and advice would be much appreciated.

<title>Terrible visibility, 12th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7698697</link>
<description>I reported this issue on 14th May, you have done nothing and said it’s completed. The visibility getting out of our lane is horrendous and very dangerous. I need you to come out and cut the verge and take back the tree growth that’s coming out. Hedge and grass verge going through Knightsbridge. It has become very dangerous getting out of slate mill lane. The visibility has got bad on the left coming from Coombe Hill and the other way towards Cheltenham is getting bad. With bad visibility and the speed the cars come down the road, there will be an accident very soon.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7698697.0.jpeg?967776dc&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7698697&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Cycle path in poor condition, 12th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7697417</link>
<description>Good morning. Please could you look at improving the condition of the cycle path between the railway bridge by Shelburne rd and the lansdown pub. Along this route of approx half a mile, the verge is overgrown, tree roots have severely damaged the tarmac and at various points it has been dug up. In general the cycle path is dangerous and, at points, not wide enough for two cycles to pass. The discomfort experienced in using the path forces cycles and scooters onto the main road, much to the annoyance of many motorists and with a higher chance of serious accidents. Many thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 88a, Lansdown Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7697417&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
