<title>Ridiculous road closure that has no purpose, 13th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8416604</link>
<description>Please remove the road closed - residents access only signs that appear in our road every time there are races at the racecourse. They were put in place on Tuesday for races that I assume start tomorrow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It serves no purpose - those who want free parking simply ignore it and come into the street and the traffic wardens cannot ticket them for doing so.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We have several delivery drivers who haven’t delivered claiming they couldn’t access the street as it was unsafe to do so. This has cost us money as we had tradesmen waiting for urgent next day deliveries that didn’t come.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I’ve asked repeatedly last year and this “what is the purpose of these signs” and received no response.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please come asap and remove them - they are nonsensical, ugly and have no purpose whatsoever. They are now causing delivery issues too.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 6, Kensington Avenue, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8416604&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Traffic light at junction of Winchcombe Street and Fairview road is faulty, 13th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8416094</link>
<description>The traffic light at the junction of Winchcombe Street and Fairview Road does not detect solo motorcycles and remains on red until a larger vehicle comes along to trigger it. When there is no traffic you have no choice other than to treat it as an uncontrolled junction, which is still technically an offence.

<title>Abandoned roadworks sign, 13th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8415832</link>
<description>Christ Church Road, outside Christchurch Court (GL50 2PZ).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sign has been kicking around for months - was originally tied to a large cone on the road verge. Cone disappeared weeks ago but sign still on pavement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Left behind by third party contractor, possibly. It&amp;#39;s now street junk and needs to be removed as whoever left it behind isn&amp;#39;t coming back for it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Christchurch Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8415832&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
