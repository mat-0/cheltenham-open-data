<title>Sequence wrong on one of the temporary traffic lights, 20th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7741119</link>
<description>The temporary traffic light is showing green too early for those coming into Cheltenham on the A46. The lights go green for those on Kidnappers Lane, and as you&amp;#39;re driving down the road (as one of the first cars) you can see that it&amp;#39;s already green for those on the A46. I&amp;#39;ve seen this 3 times, and it always seems to be that the A46 is going green too soon for those heading north.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shurdington Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7741119&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Overgrown Verges Poor Visibility on Highcross to Cirencester rd, 20th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7739569</link>
<description>Problem is high verges &amp;amp; undergrowth seriously impacting visibility on a single track road from Highcross to Highgate Farm GL53 9PG &amp;amp; onto the underpass. This narrow lane has a national speed limit Which due to the continuing A417 Brockworth to Brimsfield Cowley road about closures &amp;amp; diversions this lane is experiencing a much higher volume of non local traffic. Needless to say some people are not driving to the conditions, giving dog walkers cyclists etc very little time to react or being able to get out of the way due to land topography unkept verges &amp;amp; shrubs&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7739569.0.jpeg?c06ff7e8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cowley, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7739569&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
