<title>New traffic lights sequence, 5th June</title>

<description>The new traffic lights sequence at this crossroads is causing massive queues. When I left work at 4pm the traffic was queued back ro Lavington Drive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I understand they are just newly back in action but this needs looking at remembering there is a school that uses this exit so traffic is very bad from 3.20pm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The time allowed for cars to get out of Nine Elms Road needs to be longer to accommodate rush hour times&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Nine Elms Road, Elmbridge, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7668431&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pathway not reinstated properly after utility works, 5th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7667085</link>
<description>Hi team I&amp;#39;ve been advised that you are able to help with correcting the pathway in The Minster Churchyard Cheltenham.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We see that there has been some utilities work at the Well Walk end of the churchyard pathway. We see that the utility chaps have put down black tarmac on the pathway – rather than the carefully selected resin-type surface.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is also noted that the brickwork paving on Well Walk has been put down a little unevenly, but better than before. The double yellow lines have been reinstated. It was raised at the end of February that the whole of Well Walk needs attention, including the yellow lines which have largely disintegrated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I understood that GCC are responsible for the lighting and pathways in The Minster Churchyard, as GCC was involved in the recent project to rejuvenate the area. This was in conjunction with Cheltenham Borough Council, The Diocese of Gloucester and our Church Council.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you could look in to this - particularly the reinstatement of the original pathway surface to match. It should also be noted that any work in The Minster grounds need acknowledgement from the church as it is a closed churchyard and still contains burial remains.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kind regards Rachel&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7667085.0.jpeg?676b3c0f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Clarence Street, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7667085&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Customer is calling and says a telegraph post has been installed on the footway next to their property. They say it is close to their boundary wall and is looming over their property. They are also concerned that if this may fall it would go onto their property.

<title>Storm drain blocked between Green Cottage and the drainage ditch opposite, 5th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7666247</link>
<description>The drainage ditch to the rear of the Old Meeting House feeds into an underground pipe (Point A) that runs under the rear of Yew Tree Lodge and on to an access chamber to the rear of Green Cottage (Point B). I have &amp;#39;rodded&amp;#39; this section and it appears to be clear. I have attempted to rod from point B towards point C but the pipe is blocked approximately 24 metres from Point B. I believe the pipe should exit into the drainage ditch at Point C.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a result of this blockage the drainage ditch to the rear of The Old Meeting House fills and eventually floods The Old Meeting House, Green Cottage and the rear of Elm Lodge. This last happened in September 2024.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am aware that this issue has already been reported but I though it would be helpful to add some detail.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7666247.0.jpeg?cad6efb9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7666247&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
