<title>Once again I&#39;m reporting the problem with the rattling inspection cover, 16th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8303445</link>
<description>Location: The Reddings outside No&amp;#39;s 6 &amp;amp; 7 The Grange. The inspection cover which was replaced about a year ago is once again RATTLING every time a vehicle passes over it . This is very disturbing especially at night. It seems to be due to the design of these &amp;#39;split&amp;#39; covers which allows them to &amp;#39;rock&amp;#39; together with lack of maintenance.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8303445.0.jpeg?2bdc16de&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 7, The Reddings, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8303445&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>No road resurface, 16th October</title>

<description>Firstly thank you for finally funding the resurfacing of Lowdilow Lane however please can someone explain why two sections of the lane which have broken and in parts badly repaired surfaces, have not be scraped ready for a complete resurface but will only have a screed of tarmac put over them? Why is some of the lane deemed to be expired but two small sections in the middle not? Surely within a short time the bumps will come through and we‚Äôll have issues in the lane once again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also why has the road which leads to Little Orchard, Apple Tree Cottage, Furzen Cottage and Ivy Farm not been done?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The saying ‚Äò why spoil the ship for a ha&amp;#39;porth of tar‚Äô springs to mind&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I‚Äôm hoping the video I took of the lane yesterday afternoon which shows the sections not done and the poor state of these sections will be delivered, if not I‚Äôm happy to send them to a different address.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is not a wonder that road repairs cost as much when 3 staff are at the end of the road to move the 5 bollards when required and all staff were cleared and gone by at latest 2 pm yesterday when the road was closed until 3.30&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You have all the equipment here so why not do the job properly on the WHOLE lane?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I look forward to receiving a prompt reply&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many thanks&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bridget wilsdon&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8302708&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The storm drain directly outside my property has a loose grate cover. It makes a loud clanking noise every time a vehicle passes over it. This has been reported before, but the issue persists. The grate clearly moves when under load, suggesting it is not properly seated in its frame. The noise is disruptive and may indicate the structure is deteriorating, posing a safety risk if ignored. Please ensure the site is inspected during live traffic conditions, as the problem only occurs when vehicles drive over it, 16th October</title>
