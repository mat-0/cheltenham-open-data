<title>Obstruction to visibility at the junction near High Groove Way, 5th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7665577</link>
<description>I am writing to raise concerns about the hedge at No. 1 Essex Close, GL31NZ, which has been planted illegally and is causing a serious obstruction to visibility at the junction near High Groove Way. This hedge has led to numerous near misses and is putting road users at unnecessary risk. After conducting thorough investigations, including reviewing property deeds and estate plans, it is clear that this hedge has been planted outside the property&amp;#39;s legal boundary for personal gain. The household at No. 1 Essex Close has no legal claim to estate land or council land, and this hedge must therefore be removed immediately. Drivers approaching this junction struggle to see oncoming traffic without having to dangerously edge their vehicles into the road. In addition, the presence of streetlights buried within the hedge clearly indicates that it extends beyond the property boundary and onto council land. The red fence behind the hedge further proves that the planting is outside the rightful boundary of the property. Under Section 154 of the Highways Act 1980, the council has the authority to require the removal or trimming of any vegetation obstructing visibility and causing a danger to road users. Part 8 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 also allows councils to take action where high hedges negatively impact public safety and enjoyment of a space. This is not just an inconvenience—it is a safety hazard that affects local residents and tax-paying motorists. The selfish actions of one household should not endanger others or make daily driving unnecessarily difficult. I urge the council to take swift and decisive action to remove this hedge and restore safe visibility at this junction. I look forward to your prompt response and to seeing the necessary steps taken as soon as possible.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7665577.0.jpeg?0b55dd74&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Highgrove Way, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7665577&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Trees are totally covering any sight of the traffic lights, 5th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7665057</link>
<description>On the A40 the trees need to be taken right back further down the A40 from the Petrol Station to the traffic lights as it is impossible to see the lights until you reach them. There are large yellow warning signs advising lights in 400yds but most people miss them completely. The trees need to be cut at the top, not just the bottom section.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): A40, Andoversford, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7665057&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Whilst the vegetation has been cleared from one entry into the chicane, visibility from the other end is obscured by long grass and presents a risk to all road traffic.

<title>Traffic calming on Gotherington lane is dangerous, 4th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7662868</link>
<description>The Traffic calming on Gotherington lane is dangerous as the verges are not maintained on a monthly basis. It is not easy to see oncoming traffic....particularly if the vehicle is not tall. Seeing cyclists is also an issue. Please remove the traffic calming ASAP. It would be far safer to have just a speed camera. Thereby limiting speed, maintaining traffic flow and causing less pollution due to unecessary stop start.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gotherington Lane, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7662868&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree, 4th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7662498</link>
<description>I am writing to express my deep concern regarding a serious and ongoing issue I first reported on 13th June 2022 regarding a tree growing dangerously close to my roof. This poses an imminent danger to my family, especially during adverse weather conditions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Following my initial report, I received a response from Dorothy Coopey confirming that the work had been programmed to take place, under reference number 11368736. I followed up via email on 28th October 2022, but did not receive any reply.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On 20th December 2023, I was informed by Dawn Hanker that a new work order had been raised under reference number 43087666. However, to date, no action has been taken, and the tree continues to grow, increasing the risk to my family.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This delay of nearly three years is unacceptable, especially given that the danger was acknowledged and scheduled for action in 2022. The situation is now severely impacting my children&amp;#39;s mental health and education — they cannot study or sleep peacefully, and are often forced to sleep in the conservatory during strong winds due to fear of the tree falling.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I urge you to treat this matter with the urgency it deserves. If no action is taken promptly, I will be compelled to take legal action against the Highway Authority for negligence and the potential harm to my family&amp;#39;s well-being.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please confirm the issuance of an immediate work order and the expected date for the work to be completed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 18, Limber Hill, Wymans Brook, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7662498&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
