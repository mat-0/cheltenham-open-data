<title>Road repair of a poor quality, 24th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7753431</link>
<description>You assured the local people that the road here would be properly repaired after numerous potholes formed over the winter. Instead a thin layer of tarmac has simply been laid over the uneven surface, effectively masking the potholes. The road is still as rough as ever, and now more dangerous as it&amp;#39;s harder to see the potholes. This was evident this morning after heavy rain left many puddles in the divots on the road. Please can the road be fixed properly.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Churchdown Lane, Hucclecote, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7753431&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Gravel in layby, 23rd June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7752449</link>
<description>Our shared driveway between houses Pasaderas &amp;amp; Whitewalk have continuous problems when it floods. The hardcore/gravel is washed away and leads to an unsafe surface when exiting and arriving at our houses. We have paid many times for hardcore to be delivered and we put it down ourselves. At the moment we are having a dry spell and ideal time for the surface to be levelled out. Hope you can assist.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Ermin Way, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7752449&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Road markings too faint, 23rd June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7752420</link>
<description>As live at Pasaderas notice daily cars driving too fast round the corner by the Twelve Bells pub in direction up to Birdlip. They don&amp;#39;t stick to their side of the road and encroach into the other lane. Today I had to swerve to avoid a car. The road markings are now non-existent and the SLOW down marking is no longer visable. It would also help to have a slow sign before approaching that corner maybe on the grass verge by Twelve Bells. Anything you can do to avoid car accidents. When the A417 road is closed overweeks it is even worse. The traffic is so busy all day and all night.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Ermin Way, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7752420&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Trees require maintenance, 23rd June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7751706</link>
<description>Right hand side of Laxton road trees and foliage have not been maintained for many years.These branches are in need of cutting back at a high level due to trees being severely overgrown and encroaching into the parking area. Trees have grown extremely tall and branches are now also touching end property (number 28) causing damage to guttering. Falling branches along tree line also pose risk to parked cars. These trees are located on the border between the Green lane footpath and Laxton road residential parking, and require maintenance all the way around from the beginning of parking area to the surrounding footpath to Green lane.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7751706.0.jpeg?fb58bfe0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Laxton Road, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7751706&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
