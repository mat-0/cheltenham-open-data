<title>Unsafe Road Surface Works, 18th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8042301</link>
<description>Various places on Lobleys drive, opposite Laithwaites delivery entrance for example.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to raise a serious concern regarding recent roadworks in the Coopers Edge area. The top layer of the road has been dug up in several places, but there are no warning signs, cones, or other safety measures in place to alert drivers to the uneven surface.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This situation poses a significant risk to motorists. The exposed sections of road are likely to cause damage to tyres and vehicles, and more importantly, create a potential safety hazard for all road users. It is unacceptable for works of this nature to be left without the appropriate warnings and traffic management.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can you urgently investigate this matter and confirm when corrective action will be taken to ensure the road is made safe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I look forward to your swift response.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Brockworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8042301&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Subject: Fwd: Horse caution signs request to Highways Date: 02/06/2025 16:55 From: Jasmina Tyler &lt;jasmina.tyler@shipton-village.uk&gt; To: highways@Gloucestershire.gov.uk Good afternoon, I am writting on behalf of Shipton Oliffe Parish Council to request the Horse Riders warning signs to be installed in the village. The Horse traffic in Shipton has always been high, many riders have approached the Parish Council on the subject of the impact they are feeling of the massive amount of delivery vans buzzing around, who seem to drive with reckless abandon and are even capable of hooting at the horses as they speed by. Middle Farm is host of many horses and daily ride through the village between 3 and 10 horses. We also have horses stabled at Manor Farm which are regularly excercised through the village. Additionally, we see horses periodically from neighbouring villages including Whithington, Andoversford, Compton Abdale. We require at least one horse sign at the bottom of the Syreford Road hill that rises to the white gates.The field gates there are in constant use as horses are walked up to the end house in Syreford road. There is also a serious amount of horse traffic through the High Street. A second sign as you enter the village from the Frogmill traffic lights would also be helpful. Kind regards, Jasmina Tyler CEng MICE Parish Councillor, 18th August</title>

<title>A pothole in road problem, 18th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8041074</link>
<description>Snapped of branch in middle maple tree - At end of June, in the high winds, I reported a branch had snapped off one of the large plane trees. Middle one of the 3. I think the branch was held up by the lower canopy. That branch is now dead or dying and probably needs to be removed to avoid falling into road. On image if you pan up from the lady you can see the scar on the upper branch. The second image shows the dead branch still suspended.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8041074&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
