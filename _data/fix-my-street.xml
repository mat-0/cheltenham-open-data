<title>Overgrown Verges Poor Visibility on Highcross to Cirencester rd, 20th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7739569</link>
<description>Problem is high verges &amp;amp; undergrowth seriously impacting visibility on a single track road from Highcross to Highgate Farm GL53 9PG &amp;amp; onto the underpass. This narrow lane has a national speed limit Which due to the continuing A417 Brockworth to Brimsfield Cowley road about closures &amp;amp; diversions this lane is experiencing a much higher volume of non local traffic. Needless to say some people are not driving to the conditions, giving dog walkers cyclists etc very little time to react or being able to get out of the way due to land topography unkept verges &amp;amp; shrubs&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7739569.0.jpeg?c06ff7e8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cowley, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7739569&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
