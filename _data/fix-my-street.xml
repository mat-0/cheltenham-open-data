<title>No timetables on new Bus Stops., 10th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8278641</link>
<description>New bus stops to left of Sunnyfield Lane on main road are much better and in a much safer location than old one&amp;#39;s to right of Roundabout at Cold Pool Lane. Old stops in unsafe location have been removed but some 97 and 98 Stagecoach buses still stopping at old location. New stop has had timetable boards put up for one month now but still no timetables on them, leading to confusion for passengers and bus Driver&amp;#39;s alike. Contacted Stagecoach Customer services yesterday, who&amp;#39;s call centre is in Scotland, and they do not have access to mapping system&amp;#39;s to pinpoint location, despite Postcode and name of location being given, as not a timing point and, therefore, not on Driver Duty boards. They state it is County Council responsibility to place timetables. Please get this sorted if you wish public to make use of, much better, service&amp;#39;s, particularly for many elderly residents of Sunnyfield Lane.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8278641.0.jpeg?0b9a0c46&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cold Pool Lane, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8278641&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
