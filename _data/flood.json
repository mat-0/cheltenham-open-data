The situation is now improving with reduced water levels in key hotspots.\n\nWe are monitoring the flooding affecting the Fulling Mill Lane, Singlers Marsh, and Codicote Road areas in Welwyn. \n\nFlooding to homes and businesses is unlikely at this time, but there may be a risk to very low-lying properties or those with basements. River levels in other areas remain below levels of concern. \n\nAvoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water. We are continuing to monitor the situation.\n\nThis message will be updated by 5pm, Wednesday 28th May 2025, or as the situation changes.",
