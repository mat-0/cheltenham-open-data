The river flow at Teddington Weir is low for this time of year at 8 cubic metres per second and is steady. We anticipate the flows to remain low for the nextÂ few days.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the situation.\n\nThis message will be updated by 20:00 on 12/08/25, or as the situation changes, as subsequent tides over the next couple of days may be higher.",
