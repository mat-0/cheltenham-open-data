Flooding is possible today, Friday 31 October.\n\nWe expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning. Neap tides with a small tidal surge mean that the low tides are not very low, restricting drainage and preventing water levels in the Broads to drop more quickly. We expect levels to start returning to normal soon.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the situation. Avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded.\n\nThis message will be updated by 10:00am tomorrow, Saturday 1 November 2025, or as the situation changes.\n",
