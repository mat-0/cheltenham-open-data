      "message": "High river levels on Friday may lead to flooding. Flooding is possible on 29/08/2025 from 07:00 as intense (but uncertain) rainfall is forecast. Up to 40mm of rain could occur, but there is low confidence in location. If as much rain falls as predicted, then flooding could be possible. Flooding could affect a small number of properties on Bridge Road and West Common Road. Flooding could affect properties near the Witch Inn, along Hickmans Lane and Blackthorns, and odd numbered properties from 29 to 47 on Meadow Drive. River levels are likely to be higher than observed over the last 2 months. River levels should begin to fall by 12:00 29/08/2025. More rain is forecast on Monday (35mm), which could cause flood risk to return. We are clearing debris from weed screens through Lindfield, including the Builders Centre and Witch Inn. Take care and avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water. Report blockages at Bridge Road or Hickmans Lane to 0800 80 70 60. This message will be updated by 29/08/2025 15:00.",
