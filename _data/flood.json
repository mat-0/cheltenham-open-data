There is no longer a risk of flooding, though standing water and debris may still remain.\nScattered, heavy showers interspersed with sunny spells are forecast today, Friday 12/09/2025, and on Saturday. A band of widespread rain, at times heavy, is forecast on Sunday into Monday, accompanied by strong winds. The Congresbury Yeo catchment area is starting to become wetter, and the river will become more responsive to any prolonged, heavy rain.  \nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nContinue to take care on riverside roads and footpaths and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger.\nThere may still be some areas where flood water is present until it can naturally drain away.\nPlease see the GOV.UK website for a 5 day flood forecast.\n",
