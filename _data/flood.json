      "message": "Storm Claudia has caused heavy rainfall over the weekend. As a result river levels remain high, especially in the Short Ferry area, which may lead to flooding. Flooding is possible from 17 November 2025 .  Locations most affected will be low lying land and roads near rivers. Our forecasts indicate that flooding to properties isn't likely and therefore flood warnings are not expected to be issued.  We are closely monitoring the situation .  Take care and avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water .  This message will be updated by 18 November 2025 or as the situation changes.\n",
