Flooding of properties is not expected.\n\nWe believe there is a possibility of flooding for Putney Embankment (SW15), Chiswick Mall and Strand on the Green (W4), Thames Bank at Mortlake (SW14), Ranelagh Drive (TW1), Friars Lane and Water Lane (TW9), Riverside and The Embankment at Twickenham, and the Towpath below Teddington Lock. \n\nAstronomical tide levels are falling. The river flow at Teddington Weir is normal for this time of year at 12 cubic metres per second and is steady. We anticipate the flows to remain normal for the next few days.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the situation.\n\nThis message will be updated by 10:00 on 13/08/25, or as the situation changes.",
