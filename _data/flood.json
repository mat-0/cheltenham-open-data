Neap tides with a small tidal surge mean that the low tides are not very low, restricting drainage and preventing water levels in the Broads to drop more quickly. We expect levels to start returning to normal soon. \nWe are closely monitoring the situation . \nAvoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded . \nThis message will be updated by 10:00AM on 30 October 2025 or as the situation changes.\n\n",
