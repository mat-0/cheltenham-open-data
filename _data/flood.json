      "message": "High tides are expected to cause flooding overnight.\nFlooding is expected around the high tide of 01:00 BST on 31/03/2025.\nAreas most at risk are coastal roads and footpaths but some low lying properties near to the seafront may also be impacted.\nCoastal conditions are expected to improve tomorrow and no further flooding is expected.\nWe are closing flood gates.  Start acting on your flood plan if you have one.  Stay away from beaches, promenades, coastal footpaths and roads as waves and sea spray could be dangerous.  Never drive through flood water,  just 30cm of fast flowing water is enough to move your car.\nThe detailed tidal forecast for those who use it is for a peak level at Rye of 4.71mAODN at 01:00 (BST) on 31/03/2025, which is 0.33m above tide tables, with northerly force 4 winds.
