The weather increases tide table values by 0.17 m. The total forecast tide is 6.06 metres Chart Datum (3.01 mAOD) at Littlehampton. For 2 hours either side of high tide, minimal flood impacts are expected. A small amount of water could find its way behind the beach and may pond on nearby land and fields, including at Climping Street Car Park and Mill Lane. Tuesday afternoon's tide at 12:00 27/05/2025 is forecast to be 17 cm lower (2.84 mAOD). Wednesday's early morning tide at 00:30 28/05/2025 is forecast to be 13 cm higher (3.14 mAOD) and accompanied by larger waves. Similar minor flood impacts might affect land and lanes at Climping beach early on Wednesday morning. We continue to monitor the forecast and routinely check the condition of the beach at Climping. Shingle can be thrown by waves. Access could be restricted during and after high tide. Take care if visiting Climping beach. We will update this message by 18:00 on 27/05/2025.",
