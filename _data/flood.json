This is due to tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth and creating a natural tide locking effect. This will restrict the normal drainage of the Broads river system out to sea at low tide. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning. We are currently monitoring the situation and will update this message if necessary. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. Our workforce are out checking flood defences and clearing weed screens. We will update this message by 3pm tomorrow, Monday 6th October, or as the situation changes.\t\n",
