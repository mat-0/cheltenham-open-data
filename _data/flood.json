This is a very large volume in a short period of time.\nDue to the intensity and volume of the rain which has already fallen, from 16:00 this afternoon (31 July 2025) Bridge Road will be flooding. Water in the river will also rise to bank full over the next half an hour and it may also come out of bank. This will increase flood depths in the road and at the riverside car park, but flooding of property directly from the river is not expected.\nHeavy rain will continue to affect the area for the next few hours. Water levels will remain very high over the next few hours but should fall by 19:00 hours.\nWe are also keeping debris screens at Bridge Road clear of blockages.\nAs a precautionary measure, we would encourage residents with flood protection products to install them now.  \nThis Flood Alert will be updated by 20:00 on 31 July.\n",
