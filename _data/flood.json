Consequently, flooding is possible today, Friday, 12/09/2025, on low lying land and roads near the Congresbury Yeo, particularly roads at Wrington and Iwood. No property flooding is expected. \nScattered, heavy showers interspersed with sunny spells are forecast today, and Saturday, with a band of widespread rain on Sunday, accompanied by strong winds. \nWe are closely monitoring the situation and will issue further flood alerts if and when necessary. Our staff are checking defences and clearing weed screens. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near rivers, plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads, which may be flooded, and refer to local authority websites for local road conditions. \nThis message will be updated by 5:00 PM, Friday 12/09/2025, or as the situation changes.\n",
