      "message": "Groundwater levels remain high at our Stonor borehole near Henley and Assendon. Groundwater levels are above normal for this time of year and remain at a level at which communities may be affected by groundwater flooding. This week is forecast to be unsettled. We expect groundwater levels to remain high for the next few weeks and levels are sensitive to sustained periods of rainfall. Low lying land, roads and properties will therefore continue to be at risk of flooding. We are continuing to monitor groundwater levels and will update this message next week, by 22/04/2025, or as the situation changes. ",

This is due to persistent rainfall in December and January which has led to high groundwater levels. \n\nWe are monitoring the flooding that is currently affecting the Fulling Mill Lane, Singlers Marsh, and Codicote Road areas in Welwyn. \n\nThere is elevated risk of flooding caused by water emerging from a third party blocked culvert. Flooding to homes and businesses is unlikely at this time, but there may be a risk to very low-lying properties or those with basements. River levels in other areas remain below levels of concern. \n\nAvoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water. We are continuing to monitor the situation.\n\nThis message will be updated by 5pm, Wednesday 16th April 2025, or as the situation changes.",
