      "message": "This message has been issued because some minor flooding to riverside roads and footpaths is likely between approximately 12:30 and 2pm this afternoon, Saturday 11th October.  This is due to tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth and creating a natural tide locking effect. This will restrict the normal drainage of the Broads river system out to sea at low tide. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning.  We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting the situation to escalate.  We will update this message by 5pm today, Saturday 11th October.",
