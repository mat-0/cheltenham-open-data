- The storm drain directly outside my property has a loose grate cover. It makes a loud clanking noise every time a vehicle passes over it. This has been reported before, but the issue persists. The grate clearly moves when under load, suggesting it is not properly seated in its frame. The noise is disruptive and may indicate the structure is deteriorating, posing a safety risk if ignored. Please ensure the site is inspected during live traffic conditions, as the problem only occurs when vehicles drive over it, 16th October :- [8302537](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8302537)
