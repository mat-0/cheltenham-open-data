- The speed bump on Jasmine Way near Morrisons (Cheltenham) is poorly maintained and potentially non-compliant. It has visible surface cracks, loose or misaligned block paving, worn road markings, and a steep ramp gradient. These issues make it unsafe and can damage vehicles even at low speeds. The markings are barely visible, and the structure is degrading â€” it poses a hazard to drivers and may already have caused vehicle damage., 29th June :- [7782643](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7782643)
