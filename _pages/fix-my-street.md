- A small piece of land alongside Betty Robertâ€™s Lane (the public footpath along Ham brook) is being widened and is significantly restricting the size and use of the public footpath. Material has been put in Ham brook (narrowing the brook) to allow more of the footpath to be enclosed by a fence. This work in the brook is visible in the photos. The footpath is now very restricted and use for wheelchair or prams may be blocked. Can an immediate cease and desist notice be served whilst all the legalities are sorted as further work is continuing every day?, 15th October :- [8298437](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8298437)
