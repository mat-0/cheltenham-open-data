- Out walking today I walked into a sign that is far too low on the lamppost and almost knocked myself out whilst also receiving a cut to the head. I have photographs of the post and the damage to my head but are unable to share these on this platform. The post is located on the Charlton Lane / Greenhills Road, close to the mini roundabout. The post contains a sign for the Zebra Crossing and Leckhampton Cycle Information, the latter being the sign that is way too low. I would be grateful if this could be addressed to avoid any further danger to pedestrians. Many thanks., 2nd May :- [7516364](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7516364)
