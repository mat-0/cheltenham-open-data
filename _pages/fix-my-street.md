- There are several blocked drains on Sandy Lane (deeply caked up, not just superficial blockage of grille), so not functioning as drains at all. There is also a drain on the mini roundabout at junction with Greenhills Rd that was fully silted up (I dug a lot of it out at dawn today but as traffic became active it wasn’t safe to continue). In heavy rain the blocked drain on the roundabout causes local flooding on the roundabout and the blocked drains on Sandy Lane mean that water has to flow in larger volume, veering into Withyholt Park which overwhelms the drains and threatens partial flooding of the properties. Please could you send a team to dig out these drains (safely) so that they can function as drains again. Many thanks in advance., 25th October :- [8337667](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8337667)
