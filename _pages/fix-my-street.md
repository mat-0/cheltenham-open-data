- The tree on the pavement outside number 19 Chatsworth drive, GL530AG has very low hanging branches. You have to duck to walk on the pavement. Its branches are also hanging over our property (no 19) and dropping crab apples on our front garden. Can someone cut it so you don’t have to duck under it and so it doesn’t overhang or am I allowed to do it? It is growing at an angle too. The crab apples drop everywhere, making a mess of the pavement and clog the drain on the road. It also attracts a lot of wasps. Could a different tree be planted at all? If not it definitely needs straightening and cutting back., 25th July :- [7932808](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7932808)
