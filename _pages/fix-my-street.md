- Flyposter on street furniture at traffic lights, 6th October :- [8258699](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8258699)
- Please can you get the temporary traffic lights removed from the junction of manor road and runnings road cheltenham. They are not needed and are constantly holding traffic up. Second to this they keep breaking down. The junction worked perfectly fine before. The new traffic lights that have cost the tax payers money, have now not been commissioned for nearly a year so there must be a fault or the clueless installation team forgot the cables or something as stupid as. Again these are a waste of time, money and electricity. A simple roundabout would have kept the traffic moving, no hold ups and would have been far cheaper to maintain and caused less inconvenience., 6th October :- [8258672](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8258672)
