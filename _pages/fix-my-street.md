- The traffic lights at this junction between Cheltenham Road East and Down Hatherley Lane are fitted with louvres, presumably so that only the appropriate line of traffic can see them. The angle of the louvres is badly out, so that the light can hardly be seen at all. Coming through this junction this morning from the Cheltenham direction a motorhome started to pull out of Down Hatherley Lane in front of me. I believe I had a green light, but it wasn't easy to see. Perhaps the motorhome also thought they had a green., 1st July :- [7792631](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7792631)
