- Extreme danger to pedestrians and cyclists as the new pathway between Bishops Cleeve joins Cleeve Road. The pathway ends and pedestrians have to walk along a narrow stretch of Cleeve Road to get into Gotherington. It is only just inside the 30 limit, there is no verge, the road is narrow and there is a sharp bend. Move the speed limit sign back, make a 20mph section put in rumble strips.
