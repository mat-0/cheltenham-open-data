- Flooding outside door as you have not fixed a tarmacing error from almost 2 years ago. Which created a ditch for water to sit in. The assessor came at beginning of this year to say will be done by next April 2026? Is that normal. I think not.

- To take an individual photo will not show the extent of the problem.Since the temporary closure of the A40 at Charlton Kings the road from Whittington to Aggs Hill is experiencing far too much traffic by people using it as a shortcut to Cheltenham making it unbearably busy and with little thought to local people .The road is collapsing in many places along with the verges.As a matter of some urgency repair work will be necessary once normal traffic resumes with the re-opening of the A 40 once the bridge repairs are completed ., 14th November :- [8419892](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8419892)
