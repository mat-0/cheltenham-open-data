These must be fixed properly then., 2nd September :- [8106026](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8106026)

- Increase in dog fouling incidents - Salvia Close, Wisteria Way, Cheltenham Road East, 1st September :- [8105144](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8105144)
- Shaw Green Lane has a very uneven road surface. Potholes recur and need repair on a regular basis. Please can the Lane be resurfaced. It has not been resurfaced in 30 years. The surface resembles a patchwork quilt. A local taxi driver expressed concerns about driving on the lane and potential damage to his car. We live with it every day., 1st September :- [8105084](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8105084)
- Union flag hung from lamppost, 1st September :- [8104817](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8104817)
- The barrier that’s been left behind caused me to crash my bicycle, 1st September :- [8104770](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8104770)
- Barrier around pothole caused me to crash, 1st September :- [8104737](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8104737)
- Bank on pavement (Highways) side has completely eroded and fallen into the stream. This has been reported previously and we got an email back from Nicky Kelly about Riparian Rights, Hiwever you cannot reply to those emails and then the case gets closed. The damaged is on the Highways side and as you can see the other side the responsibility of the home owner is well maintained. There is a steep drop into the stream and Highways should visit and decide how to fix. Highways did put slabs on the Highways side at the next property along (Brenzett) a few years ago, so they clearly thought it was their responsibility then. If you reply by email, please provide a contact name number or email we can respond to if needed., 1st September :- [8104636](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8104636)
- Cone left, 1st September :- [8104497](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8104497)
- Lots of debris on the cycle path (gravel/leaves etc), 1st September :- [8104005](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8104005)
- Hanging branches frequently get knocked off by passing high vehicles or fall during high winds. Not only is there no pavement in this area, a regularly used footpath from Byfield Close emerges onto Gambles Lane at this point and there is no option but to walk in the road. Should branch(es) fall, serious damage could be caused to passing pedestrians (many of whom are schoolchildren) or vehicles. Furthermore, although I have always picked up and disposed (recycled) fallen branches, in my mid-80s I am less inclined or able to do this. In my view, serious consideration needs to be given as to whether this particular tree is appropriate for this location., 1st September :- [8103976](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8103976)
