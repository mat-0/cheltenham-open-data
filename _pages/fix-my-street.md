- Footpath is overgrown with grass/nettles and weeds. Crossing point, with textured paving for visually impaired is 90 per cent covered with soil and foliage. Extremely difficult to see cars speeding round the corner. The footpath has been marked up with spray paint saying 300m but that was several weeks ago and nothing has been done. This is the path used by many to take children to school and car drivers are unable to see them crossing the road until the last minute., 17th June :- [7722804](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7722804)
