- My concern is that a neighbour who recently achieved a Planning Consent (Application 24/01377/FUL. 9 Merestones Drive) for an extension on house, has shown intention to extend his rear garden into the verge behind his rear fence which backs onto the cul-de-sac on which l and other neighbours have access from to our homes. Although this is second hand, I understand that 9 Merestones Drive has purchased the ground of the verge, as it was owned by the builder who built this development some 45 years ago. But that from enquiries with Cheltenham Borough Council he will not have purchased the 'Rights' over the verge which give permission to move fence towards the kerb against the cul-de-sac. The Rights also protecting the trees within the verge. I understand that these Rights are under the GCC Highways control. My initial concern is to protect the visual appearance of the cul-de-sac which benefits those using this area with grass verges rather than have one side shielded by a fence on the road kerb. I also believe another householder is considering doing the same. Apart from amenity there may also be an issue with vision by people using the turning head at the head of cul-de-sac, where sight lines are minimised. Can you advise me whether an Application to acquire the Rights' over the verge is possible and if so, could I and my neighbours be able to buy them in order to keep the status quo, rather than risk the area being spoilt? Naturally I would need to take advice on this., 30th April :- [7505324](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7505324)
