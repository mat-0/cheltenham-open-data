- Very dangerous situation! We live on Church street, on the one way road around St Mary’s church, in Charlton Kings village. I have seen all day, the chaos that is prevailing in this area, including lorry’s mounting pavements, lorry’s going the wrong way because they are unable to get around the church, due to heavy vehicles and huge traffic using the village local traffic route, instead of the Cirencester Road diversion due to the A40 Charlton kings road works. Three schools are on this route, someone is going to get killed. Please sort better diversion signage, and this needs to be policed., 3rd September :- [8115235](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8115235)
