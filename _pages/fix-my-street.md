- Subject: Fwd: Horse caution signs request to Highways Date: 02/06/2025 16:55 From: Jasmina Tyler <jasmina.tyler@shipton-village.uk> To: highways@Gloucestershire.gov.uk Good afternoon, I am writting on behalf of Shipton Oliffe Parish Council to request the Horse Riders warning signs to be installed in the village. The Horse traffic in Shipton has always been high, many riders have approached the Parish Council on the subject of the impact they are feeling of the massive amount of delivery vans buzzing around, who seem to drive with reckless abandon and are even capable of hooting at the horses as they speed by. Middle Farm is host of many horses and daily ride through the village between 3 and 10 horses. We also have horses stabled at Manor Farm which are regularly excercised through the village. Additionally, we see horses periodically from neighbouring villages including Whithington, Andoversford, Compton Abdale. We require at least one horse sign at the bottom of the Syreford Road hill that rises to the white gates.The field gates there are in constant use as horses are walked up to the end house in Syreford road. There is also a serious amount of horse traffic through the High Street. A second sign as you enter the village from the Frogmill traffic lights would also be helpful. Kind regards, Jasmina Tyler CEng MICE Parish Councillor, 18th August :- [8042054](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8042054)
