- I purchased an apartment at the front of 109 - 111 Bath Road overlooking the beautiful college, and for whatever reason, just recently, this view has been completely ruined by the proliferation of bright orange electric scooters parked right in front of the college grounds!! This evening there are 34 of them across the road and the number keeps on growing. These machines are a total menace and need to be regulated in where they can be left. I am looking to you, as a tax payer, to please get to grips with this epidemic... Kind regards Matthew Millward, 29th April :- [7500589](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7500589)
