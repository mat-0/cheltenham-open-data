Forecast high water is 21:30 on 29/04/25 with a level of 7.44 mAOD and a Force 2 Southerly wind. Times are local and refer to the high water time at Avonmouth, however conditions may apply one to two hours either side of the high tide. mAOD is height above average sea level for more detail refer to local tide tables.
There is a possibility of high water levels for the tidal River Avon from Sea Mills to Conham in Bristol and between the Avonmouth Bridge and Shirehampton Park including Pill and Shirehampton. Flooding to roads and farmland is possible but properties are not expected to flood at this point. We are closely monitoring the situation. Be careful along beaches and low lying coastal footpaths and roads. No further tidal flood alerts are expected this week.
